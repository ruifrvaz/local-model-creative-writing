"""
Comparison and scoring functions for fine-tuning benchmarks.

Calculates similarity scores between baseline and fine-tuned outputs:
- Individual metric similarity (vocabulary, structure, style)
- Weighted transfer score (overall effectiveness)
- Statistical significance testing

All functions accept metric dictionaries from style_metrics.py.
