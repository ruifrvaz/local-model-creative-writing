- **Average** for metrics (with ranges)
- **Common presence** for patterns (2+ sections)
- **Document variations** as arc progression, not inconsistency

**Typical Consistency Patterns:**
- Technical conventions tend to be highly consistent
- Core vocabulary usually has significant overlap
- Sentence structure may vary within normal range

**Common Variations:**
- Pacing differences by narrative phase
- Dialogue density by scene type
- Emotional intensity across story arc
- Description detail by context

# REFERENCE GUIDE (Educational Only)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This section provides examples to help recognize patterns during accumulation. **DO NOT** use these as expectations or try to fit agent findings into these categories. Record what the agent actually discovered, not what this guide suggests might exist.

---

## POV Types Reference

### First-Person (Subjective)
- Narrator is a character: "I walked," "We decided"
- Limited to narrator's knowledge
- Intimate, subjective perspective
- Example: *"I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong."*

### Second-Person (Direct Address)
- Addresses reader/protagonist as "you"
- Creates immediacy and immersion
- Less common in novels
- Example: *"You step into the corridor, your pulse racing."*

### Third-Person Limited
- "He/she/they" from one character's perspective
- Access to one mind at a time
- Most common in modern fiction
- Example: *"Sarah entered the room, wondering if anyone would notice."*

### Third-Person Omniscient
- "He/she/they" with access to multiple perspectives
- Narrator knows more than characters
- Classical narrative style
- Example: *"While John searched the archives, miles away Maria discovered the truth."*

## Usage Instructions

1. **Read agent analysis first** - Don't look at reference until after reviewing findings
2. **Use for recognition** - "Oh, that's third-person limited" not "It should be third-person"
3. **Expand categories** - Agent may find patterns not listed here
4. **Trust the agent** - If findings don't match reference, record what agent found
5. **Create new categories** - This manuscript may have unique elements

**Remember:** This guide helps you understand and categorize what was found. It does NOT tell you what to look for or expect.
