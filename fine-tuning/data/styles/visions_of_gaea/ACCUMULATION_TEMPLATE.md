## Vocabulary Accumulation

### Merge Process
1. Extract all unique terms from each section's vocabulary list
2. Remove duplicates (keep union)
3. Categorize: Technology / Society / Concepts / Locations / Actions
4. Note frequency if available (terms in all 3 sections = core vocabulary)

### Section 1 Unique Terms
[Paste vocabulary from section 1]

### Section 2 Unique Terms
[Paste vocabulary from section 2]

### Section 3 Unique Terms
[Paste vocabulary from section 3]

### Unified Vocabulary List
**Core Terms (in 2+ sections):**
- [Terms present across sections]

**Section-Specific Terms:**
- Section 1 only: [Setup-specific terms]
- Section 2 only: [Development-specific terms]
- Section 3 only: [Climax-specific terms]

## Notes

**Merge Strategy:**
- **Union** for vocabulary (all unique terms)
- **Average** for metrics (with ranges)
- **Common presence** for patterns (2+ sections)
- **Document variations** as arc progression, not inconsistency

**Expected Consistency:**
- POV: 95%+ second-person
- Italics usage: Consistent
- Scene breaks: Consistent
- Core vocabulary: 70%+ overlap
- Sentence structure: ±10% variation is normal

**Acceptable Variations:**
- Pacing (faster in action, slower in exposition)
- Dialogue density (higher in social scenes)
- Emotional intensity (builds toward climax)
- Description detail (more in worldbuilding, less in action)
