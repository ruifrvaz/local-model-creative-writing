## Core Voice Patterns

### POV Formula
```
PROTAGONIST SECTIONS:
[you] + [past tense verb] + [object/action]
"You walked down the corridor."
"You felt the presence of your Unit."

NARRATOR COMMENTARY (Italicized):
...opening ellipsis...
[philosophical observation] + [direct address] + [rhetorical question]
...closing ellipsis...
```

### Sentence Rhythm Patterns

**Pattern 1: Action-Reaction**
```
[Action sentence, medium length]. [Reaction sentence, shorter].
"You knocked once, stopped, and then twice. Then you waited."
```

**Pattern 2: Environmental-Character**
```
[Setting description, long]. [Character focus, medium].
"Beyond, was the vast darkness of the sea, whose frozen waters already slept quietly. You guided your weary feet upon the snow-laden Coastal Walkway."
```

**Pattern 3: Dialogue-Beat-Dialogue**
```
'[Speech],' [attribution + action beat]. '[Continued speech].'
"'Well...yes,' you quoted amusedly. 'And did you see the way she blushed?'"
```

---

## Dialogue Patterns

### Attribution Formulas

**Standard (60%):**
```
'[Dialogue],' [subject] [said/asked/answered].
"'Are you for certain?' Haji asked."
```

**Action Beat (25%):**
```
'[Dialogue],' [subject] [action]. '[Continued dialogue].'
"'Obviously,' Jack stretched his arm around her and released his huge glinting smile."
```

**Unattributed (15%):**
```
[Clear context] → '[Dialogue].'
"They utterly ignored him."
```

### Speech Register Template
```
FORMAL (default):
- Full words: "do not" not "don't"
- Formal address: "Salutations," "I shall," "do refrain from"
- Complete sentences

YOUTH CASUAL (rare):
- Slightly relaxed but still formal
- Occasional humor through action, not words
- Never slang
```

## Description Patterns

### Environmental Opening
```
[Time marker], [location] [verb of being/state] [sensory detail].
"That morning, the metropolis awoke to the usual sound of citizens flowing in the streets."
```

### Character Description (Scattered)
```
[Character] + [single physical detail] + [action context]
"She took her neuropad from her utility belt and unrolled it on the table."
(NOT: "She was a tall woman with brown hair and green eyes who always...")
```

### Worldbuilding Integration
```
[Action using technology] → [function implied through use]
"you felt the presence of your Unit as she warned you of a communications request"
(NOT: "Your Unit, which was a device that allowed communication, alerted you...")
```

---

## Structural Patterns

### Memory Chapter Opening
```
[Ordinal] memory - [Evocative 3-6 word title]

[Optional: Epigraph from in-world document]
[Source attribution in italics]

[Opening sentence: environmental or action anchor]
```

**Example:**
```
Fifth memory - Anatomy of a virus

[...] and the economy shall be based on the awarding and removal of Credits...

An excerpt from Annex #03: Currency and Reward Directives; 
Division of Darmian Affairs under the authority of Mentalist Silas;

The next week flew by as the expectations regarding citizenship grew.
```

### Scene Break Pattern
```
[Scene closing sentence - atmospheric or forward momentum]

***

[New scene opening - different POV/time/location]
```

### Narrator Commentary Pattern
```
[Main narrative ending]

...what was the meaning of these names...
[Philosophical observation]
...Haji...who are you...

[Main narrative continues]
```

---

## Emotional Expression Patterns

### Restraint Formula
```
INSTEAD OF: "You felt angry."
USE: "You expelled your impatience through your nostrils."

INSTEAD OF: "You were nervous."
USE: "Your heart pounded in your chest."

INSTEAD OF: "She was sad."
USE: "Her eyes lowered and her voice softened."
```

### Intensity Spectrum

| Intensity | Technique | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Low | Environmental metaphor | "frozen waters already slept quietly" |
| Medium | Physical manifestation | "heart pounded," "weary feet" |
| High | Sensory overload | "all your senses were roused to their fullest" |

---

## Technical Conventions

### Capitalization Quick Reference
```
CAPITALIZE:
- Species names: Antiga Pyre, Nova Pyre
- Place names: Darm, East Boulevard, Hub
- Technology proper nouns: Unit, Mother, Netcore
- Titles with names: Mentalist Silas

LOWERCASE:
- General terms: apprentice, mentor, darmian
- Titles without names: "the mentor said"
- Common technology: neuropad, facemask, sentinels
```

### Punctuation Usage
```
SINGLE QUOTES: All dialogue
EM-DASHES: Parenthetical insertions ("however indirect as it might have been")
ELLIPSES: Narrator commentary framing, trailing speech
SEMICOLONS: Connecting related independent clauses (formal prose)
*** : Scene breaks only
```
