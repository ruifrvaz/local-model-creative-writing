## 2. Sentence Structure Patterns

### Distribution Guidelines
- Short (<10 words): 14.4% — Use for impact moments

```

### Physical Combat Template
```
"[Character] [violent verb] + [target], [result/impact]."
Example: "You grabbed his stretched out arm and with impossible strength snapped it in two."
Example: "The punch did not carry much strength, but the force was sufficient to rip through the creature's decomposed flesh."
```

### Transformation Sequence
```
Pattern: Gradual physical description of change
"your body began to grow uncontrollably"

POV shift: Second person → Third person ("she", "her", "herself")
Tense: Remains past
Tone: Mystical, abstract, metaphysical
```

### Transcendent Prose Template

Count: 27 instances in section
```

### Scene Breaks
```
Format: *** (three asterisks on own line)
Usage: POV shifts, location changes, time jumps
Never: Within continuous action
```

### Single Quotes for Dialogue
```
All dialogue uses single quotes: 'text'
Never double quotes for dialogue
```

### Unit Communication
```
"conveyed the thought to [character]"
"you conveyed to him"
Indicates telepathic/device-mediated communication
```

## Pattern Validation Checklist

For style-transfer-generator to verify:

- [ ] Second person POV maintained (except epilogue)
- [ ] Ellipses mark internal monologue (...text...)
- [ ] Single quotes for all dialogue
- [ ] Scene breaks use *** markers
- [ ] Dialogue tags primarily "said" (50%+)
- [ ] Visual sensory details dominant
- [ ] Physical manifestation of emotion (not labels)
- [ ] Capitalized world terms consistent
- [ ] Combat sentences shorter than descriptive
- [ ] Epilogue shifts to third person "she/her"
