## Core Patterns (CRITICAL - Must Replicate)

### 1. Second-Person POV
```
Pattern: Protagonist addressed as "you" throughout
Frequency: 38.9 markers per 1000 words
Formula: [Action/sensation] + "you" + [verb] + [object/reaction]
```

**Examples:**
- "You looked around you, trying to find some clue"
- "Blood drained from your cheeks and your eyes widened in panic"
- "You felt like you had no other option"

### 2. Italicized Narrator Commentary
```
Pattern: ...brief commentary... (ellipsis-bounded)
Frequency: Every 1000-2000 words
Length: 5-20 words typically
Purpose: Foreshadowing, guidance, philosophical observation
```

**Examples:**
- `...she was kind...`
- `...who is this Mentalist...`
- `...go inside and pick it up...`
- `...the things that are foulest are buried deep within us...`

### 3. Dialogue Attribution Style
```
Pattern: Heavy unattributed dialogue (83%) + "said" (5%) + action beats (3%)
Quote Style: Single quotes only
Position: Post-dialogue attribution
```

**Examples:**
- Unattributed: `'That sounds better,' then she pointed to...`
- With tag: `'I understand, mentor Gordon,' he said despondently.`
- Action beat: `She smiled at you. 'That sounds better.'`

### 4. Scene Break Markers
```
Pattern: *** (three asterisks, centered)
Usage: POV shifts, major location changes, time jumps
Frequency: 2 per ~22,000 words
```

## Dialogue Patterns

### Character Voice Markers

| Character | Register | Sentence Length | Distinctive Features |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Alan (You) | Casual/emotional | Short-medium | "My apologies", defensive |
| Haji | Formal/logical | Medium-long | Probability references, teasing |

| Cathy | Direct/organized | Medium | Task-focused, slightly formal |
| Mentors | Formal/verbose | Long | Lecture cadence, Directive references |
| Von Howitt | Protective/urgent | Medium | "My dear", caring address |

### Dialogue Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Action Beat + Dialogue**
```
[Character] [action]. '[Dialogue].'
```
Example: "Cathy gave him a wide smile. 'Salutations.'"

**Pattern 2: Dialogue + Physical Reaction**
```
'[Dialogue],' [attribution]. [Character reaction].
```
Example: "'That is interesting,' Haji said. Sophie's lips drew a captivating soft smile."

**Pattern 3: Multi-speaker Rapid Exchange**
```
'[Speaker 1].'
'[Speaker 2],' [brief beat].
'[Speaker 1].'
```
(Minimal tags, context-clear speakers)

### Formal Ritual Phrases
- "Order ensures Progress" (greeting/farewell)
- "By your will" (subordinate acknowledgment)
- "Salutations" (formal hello)

## Description Patterns

### Sensory Priority (by frequency)
1. **Visual** (176) - Colors, light, movement, appearance
2. **Auditory** (114) - Sounds, voices, mechanical noises
3. **Tactile** (93) - Temperature, texture, physical sensation
4. **Olfactory** (4) - Rare, avoid over-using

### Setting Description Formula
```
[Location identifier] + [primary visual] + [secondary sensory] + [atmosphere]
```

Example: "The walls were made of pure gold, which reflected the bright light coming from a portentous crystal chandelier hanging from the golden ceiling."

### Character Appearance Formula
```
[Body feature] + [specific detail] + [enhancement/effect]
```

Example: "Her body was coated in short white fur, firmly adhered to her slender curves in such fashion that enhanced her sensuality."

### Technology Description Formula
```
[Object] + [appearance] + [function through action]
```

Example: "It was a tall transparent cylinder, much like an incubation tank. The touchpanel was above a small station next to the door and was waiting for input."

## Action Sequence Patterns

### Pacing Shift Formula
```
Normal prose (21+ words) → Action (compound sentences) → Aftermath (short + medium) → Dialogue (brief)
```

### Action Sentence Pattern
```
[Subject] [violent verb] [target], [immediate consequence].
```

Example: "In a roaring buzz the hoverboard bolted between two gliders, blindsiding their operators and throwing them to the ground."

### Physical Reaction Pattern
```
You [physical sensation] as [body part] [reaction].
```

Example: "Blood drained from your cheeks and your eyes widened in panic."

```
Example: "The compartments closed as you hovered your Units over its touchscreens."

**Method 2: Character Explanation**
```
'[Explanation],' [character] explained.
```
Example: "'You do know that the probability of falling is close to zero,' Haji explained before he himself stepped inside the tube."

**Method 3: Document Excerpt**
```
''[Historical/technical text]''

An excerpt from [source];
```

## Tone Patterns

### Emotional Restraint Formula

Instead of: "[Character] felt [emotion]"
Use: "[Physical manifestation] [implied emotion]"
```

- Use: "Blood drained from your cheeks and your eyes widened"

- Instead of: "She was happy"
- Use: "Her face lit with joy" or "Her lips drew a wide smile"

### Tension Building Pattern

Normal scene → Rising detail density → Peak physical reaction → Controlled release
```

### Philosophical Commentary Pattern
```
...brief italicized insight about situation/character/theme...
```
Example: `...the things that are foulest are buried deep within us...they have neither sound...nor smell...nor shape...`

[Development - dialogue/action sequences]
[Climax - tension peak]
[Resolution/transition to next memory]
```
