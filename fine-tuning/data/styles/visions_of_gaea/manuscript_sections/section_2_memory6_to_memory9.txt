The indoctrination rooms were aligned throughout the inner arch of the hallway with their corresponding number marked above their entrance. When you entered the ''#465'' indoctrination room, you saw the mentor of Fundaments of Existence standing on the dais in front of her apprentices while waiting patiently for the signal to begin indoctrination; sitting at their desks some apprentices exchanged quiet conversations. When a clear sharp note echoed through the corridors and into the indoctrination room, the sliding door behind sealed shut and the apprentices' murmurs faded into an absolute silence. The mentor smiled and approached the first row of desks, bowing afterwards.
'Salutations, apprentices. Today we shall begin our final theme before your rightful admittance to citizenship. Once we have completed it, you shall have an extensive understanding of the pathogen that forever changed the Pyre's genetic code.'
To most of the apprentices, the mentor had an unremarkable voice, but to your ears, her voice was kind and enthralling, much unlike the dull scratchy voice of mentor Levine.
'Who amongst you can share some knowledge about the retrovirus that put an end to the Antiga Pyre?' she asked.
A few hands rose above the silent audience, belonging to apprentices that placidly waited to be called on to answer. Amongst them was Sophie's, and her eyes glinted as she restrained her excitement.
'Very well, we have four apprentices who have prepared this indoctrination. Those of you who have raised your hand, shall take turns to provide the answer in a sequential fashion. Apprentice Lauren, do you care to begin?' she asked turning her attention to Heidi.
Heidi lowered her hand and sat straight in her second-row desk, placing one hand on top of the other, and answered with her delicate voice:
'The entity known as PIn-T2, was a non-lethal retrovirus whose transmission to the host was achieved through any liquid medium. It could be absorbed through the respiratory system by means of airborne aerosols released from a contaminated host, digestive system by means of ingestion of contaminated water or food containing water, or its most effective mean, the transmission of fluids though bodily contact which led to direct absorption by the circulatory system.'
'Very well,' interrupted the mentor. 'Apprentice Adams, you may continue,' she said pointing to Andrew, an apprentice with whom you were not very well acquainted, even though he always carried a friendly expression.
Andrew spoke with proud confidence, which by itself demonstrated his desire in completing his apprenticeship as one of the top ranked apprentices, 'The retrovirus belonged to the Oxygen-Nitrogen based macromolecules, containing a reactive strand of nucleotides. Its organic structure was highly unstable due to the presence of ionized phosphate groups on its skeleton, which in conjunction with its sedimentation velocity allowed it to adhere with great ease to the eukaryotic cells of the Pyre. Once it reached the circulatory system, the retrovirus penetrated the cells by attaching itself to the nucleotides of the genetic code.'
'Well done, apprentice Adams,' the mentor congratulated.
Andrew gave her a proud look while the mentor directed her attention to Sophie, 'Apprentice Andersen, you may continue.'
'The adherence process of the viral RNA strand to the DNA molecules of the host's cells took place in the S-phase, where simply put, a cell's DNA molecules split into two and form two other DNA molecules. The adherence of the viral strand was made possible due to the enzyme integrase that allowed the retrovirus to become part of a cell's DNA through a reverse transcriptase process. As a result, when the S-phase was completed, the cell entered the mitosis phase and formed two new cells carrying the viral DNA strand. These infected cells would then carry on replicating more infected cells through the regular cell cycle. For this reason, the enzyme integrase was one of the fundamental components of the retrovirus, as it served as the tool that allowed it to become part of the cell's genetic code and establish a lifelong infection in the host.'
Haji nodded at her, and his lips moved, saying ''Superb''. 
She gave him a proud smile.
'Well presented, apprentice Andersen,' and the mentor bowed to her. 'Apprentice Emerson you may conclude.'
Francis sank down on his chair and answered timidly, 'I have not attained much more knowledge of the subject, mentor Elias. What I learned by inquiring Mother is that after a new host had been infected, its cells reproduced the retrovirus macromolecule which in turn would release itself into the environment and find new hosts through liquid medium, as Heidi mentioned.'
'Thus, completing the cycle,' mentor Elias added. Her green eyes glinted with satisfaction and her slender face was filled with a gentle smile. 'Well done. I am proud of my apprentices.'
...she was kind...and beautiful...
She was. It was since your earliest days as an apprentice that you nurtured an uncommon admiration for her. To you, every aspect of her was pleasant and proportional. Her white teeth aligned perfectly behind her thin red lips; her amber eyes warmed your heart every time she looked upon you; her captivating smile carried your thoughts away to bold fantasies. Her firm breasts filled her tight violet uniform, her waist was as smooth as a wave function, her fertile hips and her lean thighs urged you to ---
...leave my fantasies out of this and get on with this meaningless subject...
Forgive me. I shall resume. However, this subject was not as meaningless as you might consider. Within it, was an understanding to the Torment which no one except Gadim was able to fully grasp. He saw the retrovirus in its entirety, and he saw how it corrupted life, turning your kind into something that I never intended you to be.
The mentor turned to the window-wall and interacted with it, using the neurolink that rested comfortably on her right ear. The view of the Academy's inner plaza was replaced by an opaque screen of information related to the Fundaments of Existence doctrine, whose seemingly endless topics filled the wall from top to bottom. Using Thought Interaction, she accessed the topic ''PIn-S2'' and then the sub-topic ''Epidemiology''.
On the screen were displayed several images demonstrating a sequence of the infection process of the retrovirus. In one of the images, the macromolecule seemed to be in interaction with an isolated eukaryotic cell; in another was plainly visible the strand of nucleotides that Heidi had described. The images seemed to be divided in four stages and the mentor began to explain the first stage, mentioning with approval the common points that her apprentices had presented. Arriving at the second stage, she sat behind her desk and continued:
'On the second stage of incubation, we can see that the affected cells of the organism now comprise over seventy percent of the cell population, with a prevalence of approximately thirty percent on the bone tissue. In this stage, the group of signs and symptoms were still inexistent or unspecific. Consequently, it was still not possible to ascertain without clinical trial whether an organism was infected or not.'
Her soft voice was so alluring that you followed her every move and every word, from her calm gestures pointing towards the three-dimensional images, to her occasional pauses to assess whether she could continue or whether she had to explain once more.
'On entering the third stage, the incubation had successfully reached the point of irreversibility, and any attempt to eradicate the retrovirus resulted in the destruction of its host. This irreversibility is one of the two reasons why this pathogen was so effective at spreading throughout the globalized societies of the antigans. The other reason was that the host was already infectious during the incubation process, meaning that the retrovirus was free to replicate itself and spread to new hosts without any signs of infection being displayed by the carrier.'
After mentor Elias highlighted the last stage of the incubation process, the screen reproduced an animation of the retrovirus neutralizing the cell's defenses and attaching itself to a DNA strand. Its effectiveness was both admirable and disturbing.
She pointed one finger to a segment of the altered DNA, 'Once fully lodged inside the still asymptomatic host, the viral RNA strand migrated from the cells' nucleus to the cells' mitochondria, lodging itself in the DNA of this structure. The incision of the vRNA in the cell mitochondria caused a chain mutation of mitochondrial DNA, creating a pattern with a specific codon sequence known to be the Torment trigger sequence. The mitochondria's more resistant RNA molecules were unable as well to prevent this mutation due to the hypersecretion of oxygen reactive composites by the retrovirus, which neutralized any attempt to repair the damaged DNA strands. When the fourth stage was complete, the mitochondrial DNA became viral, triggering the start of an irreversible chain reaction,' said the mentor, pointing to the schematics where the viral RNA performed an alteration of the mitochondrial DNA. 'The first of our Guiding Father's accomplishments, was to discover that the transition from the incubation phase to the Torment phase followed a chain recoding of the DNA that would only commence once the mitochondria population of the host was entirely contaminated, which means that the Torment phase would wait until the incubation phase had been completed,' she said and waited for the apprentices to finish their annotations. 'There are no accurate predictions of the time span of the incubation phase, but models run by Mother suggest that this process lasted for twenty to thirty years, and we now know that this viral RNA was also able to infect the host's gametes during meiosis, meaning that any offspring would be equally infected. This was one of our Guiding Father's most important discoveries, as it allowed us to entirely understand the cause of the extinction of the Antiga Pyre. It is believed that once an offspring from an infected antigan attempted to breed with a non-infected antigan, the result would be an infertile hybrid. This means that throughout the Age of Obscurity, as all the surviving populations became infected, the Antiga Pyre withered away and eventually became extinct.'
She granted the apprentices some time to convey into their neuropads what she had said. Then, she added, answering to some keen eyes, 'This is one of the reasons why all darmians are fertilized and bred in controlled laboratory conditions and then appointed to caretakers. However, it is still a futile effort to reverse our offspring's genetic code to that of our ancestors. It may even prove impossible, since the original code was lost when the antigans became extinct.'
You raised your hand, as much out of curiosity as to grab her attention. When she nodded to you, you asked, 'Why were the antigans unable to remove the genetic flaw from their gene pool. Were they unable to use genetic programming?'
'That is a good question, apprentice Balthazar,' she answered as you welcomed her tender gaze. 'They were aware of genetic programming, but not even that was enough to stop the virus. The reason is that the retrovirus did not perform a linear mutation of the Antiga Pyre's DNA. Instead, it unevenly spread throughout their genetic code in small and very discrete codon sequences, some of them redundant, others self-reconstructive, and others seemingly normal, yet all interlinked through a process that was only discovered by the Guiding Father, after their extinction.'
'That was one smart germ!' Jack allowed himself to shout.
The class erupted in a half-suppressed laughter.
Mentor Elias calmly gazed at him, 'It was indeed, apprentice Thompson, and that is why it was successful in leading an entire species to self-extinction. You should have some respect for it, and for our ancestors.'
One by one, the apprentices quieted down, gazing at the mentor in solemn contemplation.
'My apologies, mentor Elias. I did not mean to disrespect them,' Jack spoke embarrassedly to the silent room.
'Apology accepted,' she said, throwing him a courteous smile.
After a brief pause, the mentor moved on to the next topic: ''Pathophysiology.'' 
The lights in the room waned and she continued the indoctrination on the holoprojector, letting the morning light into the room through the shaded window-wall:
'We shall now address the syndrome that the Nova Pyre has come to refer to as the Torment. These set of signs and symptoms, commonly known as manifestations, are the reason why from antigan civilization there are only buried remnants, broken artifacts, and weather-beaten ruins.'
Hovering above the holoprojector, emerged a physical representation of a male antigan, slowly rotating along a vertical axis. Its body was stubby and hairy, its skin soft and pale, its face beardy and bestial.
...they were very different from pyreans...
Evolution from Antiga Pyre to Nova Pyre produced mild to severe changes to the Pyre's constitution. Some of the changes were discrete, such as the loss of all hair in both the male and female body, apart from the head, eyebrows and eyelashes. Other were more noticeable: they became taller and slenderer, and their face uncommonly fairer and more delicate, changes that occurred because attractiveness became the sole criterion of natural selection between pyreans during the Age of Obscurity.
'The Torment can be divided into two sets of symptoms,' said mentor Elias. 'The Localized Morphological Manifestations and the Widespread Morphological Manifestations, which, as the name suggests, are either localized or widespread alterations in our body appearance. These can be temporary, or in more severe cases permanent, and are a result of the change in the genetic code responsible for our appearance.'
Mentor Elias continued to explain the Torment, using the antigan model to demonstrate different manifestations. Your astonishment grew increasingly as the model assumed various grotesque forms. On one of the Localized Manifestations, the model suffered shocking alterations to the arms; these increased in size, changing shape and radically changing their texture and color to a rugged and reddish glow.
When she moved on to the Widespread Morphological Manifestations, your astonishment turned into disbelief. On one of the first manifestations, the model grew to almost three times its size and his skin turned into a ridged shell with a brownish hue; his already brutish face became heinously deformed, the lips thick and dark, the eyes deeply burrowed into the skull as if they had been sucked in by some incomprehensible force, and his hair had extended down to its body and thickened to become a layer of menacingly sharp thorns. On one of the last manifestations the model became utterly repulsive, its skin turning into a sickening green paste, and becoming so languid it seemed to melt off its body; its limbs were reduced to large tentacles, and on its edges grew blotches and pustules, some of them erupting with a yellow slimy fluid. No apprentice was unmoved by the manifestation. Many ended up averting their eyes, and Marlene, an apprentice with a peculiarly pale skin-tone, which had become white as marble at that point, ended up throwing up her breakfast on the floor. It was after that incident that mentor Elias decided to stop the demonstrations and interrupted the indoctrination, allowing the apprentices to recover and share their thoughts, while she accompanied Marlene to the washroom.
You took the time to talk to Haji, stealing his attention from his neuropad, 'What do you think of this?' you asked feeling both curious and suspicious.
Haji gave you an upset look, 'It troubles me to know that we have the Torment inside us. Without the Personal Identification Unit, we would be vulnerable to it. Our Guiding Father might not be as great as he claims to be, but we still must thank him for what he has accomplished. He helped the Pyre reclaim its place in Artica and allowed its societies to rebuild once more.
You looked at your neuropad as the image of the manifestation rotated inside it, 'Maybe you're right...' you yielded, your suspicion turned to doubt.
...what a grand deception...

A little while after, mentor Elias returned with Marlene at her side. The apprentice was grasping her stomach, but her skin was a little less pale, which led you to assume she was feeling a little better. After dragging her feet back to her desk, she sat, quite slowly. The mentor returned to her place alongside the holoprojector and waited until the apprentices returned to their silent awareness before proceeding:
'I would like to end this indoctrination with a quick note. As you are aware, any change that occurs on a given system, however erratic it may seem, obeys a specific set of facts, or laws. It is only because of laws that we are able to predict the motion of the stars and galaxies, the weather patterns that determine Artica's climate, the cycle of our existence, and yes, even the Torment,' she said and became quiet, seeming intended to incite curiosity. After sitting behind her desk and quietly conveying some thoughts to her neuropad, she continued, 'As such, I wish you to research the set of laws related to the Torment as they are presented in Gadim's Theorem regarding Phenotype Rearrangement which shall be the theme for the upcoming indoctrination. The criteria for Credits awarded shall be based on the knowledge of the topic, clarity of the presentation and conclusions drawn from the research. The respective Credits are five, ten and fifteen.' She rose from her seat and walked towards the edge of the dais, 'Does anyone need me to clarify any subject?'
A multitude of arms were raised. 
Given the short amount of time before the signal, mentor Elias allowed only one question. To be impartial in her choice, she used her neurolink to generate a random name and then present it on the walls so that everyone could see. Leonard was the apprentice Mother chose, highlighting his name in big letters on the walls.
Leonard was not the type of apprentice that would actively participate in any discussion. Throughout the years he had developed - nearly at a mastery level - the ability to pay attention to both the indoctrinations and Heidi, an apprentice he had become irresistibly infatuated with. During any given indoctrination he would devote his eyes to the mentor, and his ears to Heidi, who was sitting next to him. When he saw his name floating on the walls, he felt his secret had been discovered, and Heidi's eyes and ears had now turned to him. He could not help but feel that he was being punished somehow, since now he had no other choice but to become the center of her attention.
He asked with a tremulous, shrill voice, 'Mentor Elias, I understood how the retrovirus managed to spread throughout the Antiga Pyre and create us. And I also understood what manifestations are. But what I did not understand - he glanced at Heidi before continuing - or at least not too well, is why the Torment has so many different manifestations.'
Mentor Elias was delighted with the apropos question. It had been the first time Leonard had participated in her indoctrinations and yet he had managed to identify the mystery behind the Torment.
'That is an excellent question apprentice Leonard. No doubt some of you are unable to understand the reason as to the enormous diversity of manifestations - some apprentices nodded their heads. - Unfortunately, the reason can only be revealed to those who succeed in becoming Project Specialists.'
Leonard's satisfaction waned into an expression of disappointment; he knew that with his credits he would never be assigned to that occupation. Conversely, a look satisfaction grew in some faces - Heidi's included - for they knew they would surely achieve Specialist Class.
'However!' mentor Elias added, pouting her lips slyly, 'one could speculate - her eyes probed the ceiling - that there could be a correlation between these manifestations and the way we experience emotions.'
Bewilderment is the most appropriate word to describe the look on the apprentice's faces, yours included. No one could understand the correlation; some found it so surprising that they raised their hands to ask for a more comprehensive explanation.
'I would be delighted to engage in further speculation,' mentor Elias continued, 'regretfully, this more confusing than explanatory conjecture will have to suffice.'
The indoctrination ended a few seconds later, leaving the room full of disappointed apprentices. One by one, they rolled up their neuropads and packed them in their utility belts, leaving the room orderly while engaged in quiet arguments. Mentor Elias remained at her desk, conveying thoughts to her neurolink. Heidi approached the desk and attempted - yet unsuccessfully - to ask for an explanation. As vain as the attempt might have been, for Leonard it was the appropriate excuse to walk up to her side and start a conversation. And so, he did, shyly.
Sixth memory - Tales of the long departed

[...] leading me to conclude that instinct and emotion became the never-ending source for all the tragedy that befell the Antiga Pyre. Further experimental research performed on infants nurtured in simulated wildlife environments revealed behaviors that in some cases surpassed even the savagery of animals, whereas the control group, when deprived from any other contact with nature, had their instincts and emotions rendered latent. This outcome could be explained by the biological affinity that we have to these animals, namely the mammals. Even though not all fauna and flora were extinct during the Age of Obscurity, it is highly recommended that darmians be kept isolated from the surviving species and the only information available regarding this matter be related to the extinct species that once co-existed with us. Furthermore, they should be known to darmians only as animals and each should be named by their scientific nomenclature, a contingency that shall uphold a sense of singularity of the pyrean species and possibly instill in them a sense of alienation that will extinguish any affinities for animals that may arise. Regardless of the outcome, I recommend continuing the research in the field of genetic remapping and attempt to remove instinct and emotion and every other genetic fault from the Pyre gene pool altogether. Although most of the first experiments were unsuccessful, some failed specimen revealed significant improvements.

An excerpt from Annex #9: On biological seclusion; 
Division of Darmian Affairs under the authority of Mentalist Silas;


With Lunch Time upon Darm, the vast mess hall of the tenth floor of the Academy was immersed in the warm fragrance of food. The large, curved window-wall opposite the entrance allowed Mithras to shine its light upon the multitude of green uniforms. The apprentices sat, chatted and chewed, smiled at each other and scraped the remainders of food from their dishes. Their lunches were being handed to them by an extensive line of food generators on top of metallic counters, which were located on the edges of the curved hall. 
After ordering and collecting the food trays, your group sat together at the only table in the mess hall: an enormous U-shaped table that extended from one edge of the hall to the other. Resting on the table in front of you, on a round metal plate, was your meal as you ordered it: a blue carbohydrates jelly cube, a colorful emulsion of mineral, a triangular prism of fibers, and a sliced brown cylinder of complementary nutrients. On a cup next to your plate was your favorite drink, a sweet and sour vitamin shake. Altogether, they comprised a third of your daily dosage of nutrients, as was determined by your Unit's health monitoring module.
While everyone enjoyed their meal, Cathy grabbed the opportunity to learn about the preparations for the Gathering:
'How are the procedures for the printing device coming along?' she asked you and Haji, with a hint of concern.
'They are practically finished,' Haji answered, sitting at your side. 'All that is left to do is run a simulation to correct any errors, which I will be doing this evening. I believe you are going to find the animal costumes quite appealing, but you really must congratulate Alan for the designs. He wrote the instructions for the animal costumes by himself.'
Cathy smiled at you from across the table, her eyes glittering with satisfaction, 'Excellent!' Cathy applauded. 'The preparations are coming along as we expected.'
'It is excellent indeed!' said Sophie, sitting next to Cathy. 'I was beginning to worry that we were going to have to postpone the Gathering due to mentor Levine's bonus presentation. We might owe everything to your efforts Alan.'
Instead of doing research for the presentation, you found that working on the instructions for the animal costumes was the best way to spend your Rest Time. Now, you felt comforted in knowing that you had helped all finalists, and you saw it as an amends for all the trouble you had caused to many of them due to your several misguided conducts throughout apprenticeship.
'It was my pleasure,' you answered with a smile.
'Moving on,' continued Cathy, 'it was the unanimous decision of all finalists that each of us will select one animal and present it one by one. The selection will be done according to the Standings' - you hung your head in disappointment - 'but, the organizers take priority over everyone else.'
'I've already chosen mine,' you promptly announced.
'I have already chosen mine as well,' Haji added.
Sophie and Cathy stared with surprise at each other. 
'And which was your choice?' Cathy asked you, a look of curiosity on her face.
Your words came out in a blend of simplicity and reverence, revealing your admiration for the animal, 'Ailuropoda melanoleuca.'
Jack gave you a dumbfounded stare, 'What is that?'
'Ailuropoda melanoleuca is the designation given to a peculiar animal. Traces of its existence were found on the oriental borders of the East Continent,' explained Cathy.
'And what makes it so peculiar?' asked Jack.
Sophie answered, 'Well, besides having a furry and adorable look, it is believed that though it shared an affinity with predators, it fed exclusively on a unique vegetable and was very affable.'
'Did you pick him because it reflects your personality?' Cathy teased.
You flushed and took a spoonful of fibers to your mouth just so you did not have to answer.
Sophie's curiosity was not yet sated, so she took the opportunity to ask, 'What about you Haji, which one did you pick?'
Haji gave her a simple yet proud smile, 'Of all the animals that I studied, the one I found most alluring was the Linx pardinus. I was astonished by its spots and long ruffs of fur beneath the chin. They were magnificent animals.'
Sophie's lips drew a captivating soft smile, 'That is interesting. I have considered choosing one that bears a strong resemblance to the Lynx pardinus.'
'You have?' he asked, and now it was his turn to feel curious, 'Which one is it?'
She pouted in a playful manner and then answered with an infantile infatuation, 'Nuh uh...I cannot say. It will be a surprise.'
'That is not fair! I told you mine,' complained Haji. Oddly to him, when gazing at her bright brown eyes the disconnected word ''jubatus'' came to his thoughts. He ignored the word entirely as he did not see her lips move.
 'I did not force you,' Sophie flicked her auburn hair. 'Trust me, my favorite darmian. It will be a lot more interesting when you find out,' she answered and winked at him across the table.
Haji admired her attractive smile as he wondered about what she had chosen, and when a strange and out-of-place silence sunk in, he realized that the rest of their friends were staring at them with amused faces.
'When did you two get so cozy together?' asked an astonished Jack.
'It does not concern you,' Cathy answered with an amused smile. 'Now, moving on. Which attires shall the rest of us choose?'
'I want a fierce animal!' Jack jumped in as loud as he could. 'The fiercest of them all!'
'In that case, choose the Panthera leo,' suggested Cathy, remembering her awe when she saw its animation in the Historical Records. 'It is considered by our Specialists to be the fiercest and most terrifying animal that existed in the obscure age. He had a formidable mane that encompassed his entire head and chest.'
'That one! That's the one!' said Jack raising his finger to the air and unleashing his disproportionate smile.
You gave Haji a sidelong look, 'I don't know if the mane can compete with his tremendous, humongous smile.'
Everyone laughed except for Jack. He frowned at you while you looked up at the metallic ceiling, your hands behind your head.
'Mock me all you want,' retorted Jack in his self-assured wittiness, 'but when the Gathering starts, and you ask me to introduce you to some of my female acquaintances you'll see how humendous my smile can be.'
You leaned forward and gave him a humble smile, 'Come on Jacky, I'm just complimenting your smile. I was saying that nothing can compete with it.'
Jack was pleased with your excuse, and his face changed from disgruntled to smiley, 'Nothing can indeed. And since I am in such good mood, you can count on me to present you to some of the apprentices from class #47. Some of them have been asking me questions about you, ever since they learned of your daring response to mentor Levine.'
Cathy's amused smile waned, and she lowered her eyes to her tray. You managed to notice, and an unsettling sense of helplessness urged you to speak to her. But you did not know how.
'Well, the Gathering's purpose is to allow finalists to find the right companion. I am sure you will find one for you Alan,' she said glancing at you with disappointment.
A veil of silence fell on you corner of the vast table, surrounded by the echoes of clattering and racketing of cutlery and dishes and trays.
'I can hardly believe we have only four more weeks before completing the tenth and last year of apprenticeship,' groaned Jack with his mouth full. 'After that, it is time for a residence of my own and some quality time with my companion.'
Sophie gave him an absent nod.
'It is not long now until we become citizens,' said Cathy.
'Not long now,' you muttered, staring outside the window, your thoughts besieged by great unease.
...I dreaded that moment...
'What do you think mentor Elias meant by suggesting that the Torment is related to the way we experience emotions?' you asked, curious about her words and wanting to change topic. 'There was something in the way she spoke, a hidden intention.'
'It was just a hypothesis, Alan,' assured Sophie.
'A curious one indeed,' added Haji. 'That manifestations may be somehow related to emotions is a disturbing prospect.'
Jack picked up pieces of jelly from his plate, placed two pointy pieces between his teeth and lips and two other round pieces on his eyes, 'Look at me, I'm angry and I'm becoming a pestilent creature!' he said, raising claw-shaped hands at Cathy.
'That you are,' she retorted indifferently.
The pieces fell from his face and he added with displeasure, 'Come on! Are we seriously going to change topics only to feed Alan's hunger for whatever is that he likes to feed on? Theories about how the indoctrinations are meant to deceive us and how they hide from us the existence of civilizations outside Darm...'
You smiled at him. For once you agreed with him, 'You're right Jack, the Gathering is tomorrow, and we have better things to talk about.'
'And I can barely wait any longer!' Cathy added, rousing the mood. 'I want to see how I look as the animal I picked. The virtual illustration did not leave me too impressed. I might have to add some adornments,' she added with a sly look on her face.
As she curled her red hair around a finger she occasionally cast her amber eyes at you, neither smiling nor frowning. You smiled at her absentmindedly.
'I still cannot understand. Why all that interest for an attire?' Jack asked while he filled the fork.
'I do not expect you to understand,' Cathy answered, her eyes looking at the empty tray, her head resting on one hand.
Jack shrugged and filled his mouth with food.
'That's because there is nothing to understand,' he concluded while chewing. 'You girls make a fuss out of everything.'
'Jack, the Gathering is the official occasion for a finalist to choose a companion ,' Haji explained. 'It is an especially important moment for many of us, as our choice will determine whom we will be spending the rest of our existence with. Some finalists, want to look their best for the occasion.'
 'What about you Haji, is it an important moment for you?' Sophie asked him.
Haji looked at her and when her bright brown eyes met his hazel eyes he answered softly, 'I have already chosen my companion.'
Sophie's eyes shone bright as stars and she smiled with absolute delight. Even you, who were still worrying about becoming a citizen, turned your attention to them. It was such a weighty decision for your best friend that you felt an immense joy for him and for Sophie. 
Cathy was happy for her as well and she smiled at them, suppressing a natural hint of envy.
'Well, if no one wants you I can throw in a favor Cathy,' said a completely oblivious Jack with his mouthful.
If eyes could melt, Cathy's stare would have disintegrated Jack.
'Jacky!' Sophie intervened in a cheerful yelp, still overjoyed by Haji's indirect proposal.
Jack realized everyone was staring at him.
'What?!' he shrugged, 'I am just saying, if Cathy can't find anyone, I don't mind being her companion.'
Cathy leaned over the table and answered, smoothly, 'Jacky, I rather have the Torment manifestation that made Marlene throw up.'
The table filled with warm laughter.
'Ouch Cathy, that's harsh,' he answered and smiled at the first apprentice that walked past him, feigning indifference.
'That's well deserved!' you added while laughing.

Throughout the rest of Lunch Time, many apprentices enjoyed the fresh air outside, strolling on the grey granite slabs of the courtyard surrounding the Academy's massive building. The courtyard was decorated with elegant imposing sculptures made of polished gray stone, depicting some of the most memorable mentors to ever exist. Scattered about, were tall and sparkling water fountains mixed with anticoagulant and long benches, kept warm and dry by an internal heating device. 
You and Cathy sat on one of them and enjoyed a truly admirable view of the Netcore. Like a tall pillar of light, it rose from the Central Circle and pierced the clear blue sky, reflecting Mithras as it shone upon her permaglass and impermium countenance. Jack was standing next to you, but he was distracted from the conversation you were having with Cathy, as he was engaged in the repetitive task of greeting female apprentices with his large disproportionate smile as they walked past him. Sophie and Haji were keeping a private distance from the rest of the group. Sophie would smile at him and comb her hair with her fingers, while Haji had the same confused look he used to have when he was unable to understand something. Nevertheless, nearing the end of Lunch Time, they both shared a lasting hug before standing up.
You did not pay much attention to the Citizen's Directives doctrine that afternoon. You were otherwise intrigued about mentor Elias' last statement and your mind kept trying to find a relationship between emotions and the Torment. Therefore, you barely listened to the topics mentor Lauren indoctrinated with dogmatic determination, regarding the complex hierarchies that gave structure to the administrative levels of the Project Facility.
Seventh memory - Mother

''When I authorized Miriam to breed the descendant, I did so under the condition that Alan Balthazar were to reside alone and be deprived of any primary socialization for his isolation was indispensable for the Project. It was for that reason as well that to him alone I granted the freedom to reprogram his host and gave him full access to Mother, even if for him it would seem granted through the guise of deception. It was perhaps out of whim, perhaps out of carelessness towards the higher order of causality, that to him alone I granted also the chance to keep his Affection Support Droid beyond his infanthood.''

An excerpt rescued from the final diary of Gadim: Regarding Alan Balthazar's early life;


That night, you spent Dinner Time in Haji's residence. Once you arrived at the front entrance, the welcoming was short, and it was not long afterward that the four of you were sitting at the dining room table.
'Dinner is served,' announced Haji's female caretaker, setting a pan drenched with condensation on the table. She opened the pan, and a dense cloud of vapor filled the room, 'Nutrients salad with sweet sauce, your favorite, Haji.'
Haji's hungry eyes widened once the steam scattered from inside the pan, revealing a colorful assortment of jelly cubes dipped in sauce. Once you had all served your plates, you ate and drank in silence. Haji's caretakers were middle-aged darmians. They were both quiet and composed: the female a gentle-looking pyrea with dark-brown eyes and ash-brown hair; the male a surly pyrean of pale skin-tone with short dark-brown hair and soft hazel eyes. They belonged to the twenty fifth generation of darmians and were currently completing their final year as citizens. At the end of the year, they would be granted their Honorable Retirement and given passage to the Isle of Retirement, where they would spend the rest of their existence.
Once you were done eating, you had a somber and unsmiling conversation with them. You talked about the latest indoctrinations at the Academy, shared your disquiet about becoming a citizen and managed to ask some questions about their occupations. The male caretaker was one of the many spaceport administrators whose task was to perform maintenance on the shuttles that transported cargo and personnel to the Vanguard and Renaissance research stations established on the lunoids, while the female was one of the Darmian Support Center administrators, whose task was to ensure the delivery of the daily orders performed by every darmians. Despite your curiosity in learning more, neither one of them seemed interested to talk about the more specific details of their occupations, rather taking turns in glancing discretely at the sofa in the living room. When you ran out questions - much to their relief - they got up from the table only to sit on the sofa while you and Haji took the dishes, forks, cups and pans to the appliances room .
After clearing the table, you followed Haji towards the sofa. You considered sitting next to Haji's caretakers, but their dullness was beginning to make you sleepy, so you stopped before them and said politely, 'With your leave, I will be returning to my residence.'
'So soon?' Haji asked.
Your fingers drummed on the end-table next to the sofa as you tried to find a convenient excuse. When none came, you confessed, 'I want to learn more about what mentor Elias said regarding the Torment before I rest.'
Haji realized your discomfort and gave you an understanding smile, 'Very well,' he said. 'I will see you out.'
'Have a pleasant evening, apprentice Balthazar,' Haji's caretakers added, giving you an absent nod.
After Haji walked you to the door and bade you a pleasant Sleep Time, you allowed the lashing cold of the night lead you to your residence, and the warm embrace of your residence lead you to your bedroom.

To you, the room was mildly unkempt. To your caretaker, who was at that time on the Vanguard station, it would look like an appalling den of carelessness. Thoughtfully attached to the walls and the ceiling above the bed were three holoscreens looping animated recordings of hoverboarders in acrobatic jumps that defied gravity. Floating in three-dimensional letters in the one attached to the ceiling was the name ''Roddius Browning'' below the replay of a hoverboarder performing a triple back-flip after a daring jump from a steep ramp. Worn uniforms and boots were piling up near the opened wardrobe on the right, which was imbued on the wall. To the left, below to a wide window, was your bed, unkempt from the previous night of rest, and opposite the entrance was a wide U shaped desk. The left side was filled with stacks of nanosheets with the one at the top highlighted with the title ''Swoosh! Combat Strategies''. Resting on the right side, was a neuroglove.
You sat in the modest but comfortable hoverchair and floated forward until you stopped at the center of the desk. In your hands was your Affection Support Droid, a small fluffy teddy droid. You had found it powered down, lying on the bathroom shower. 
The terminal was in suspension mode, the wide holoscreen on the wall displaying a three-dimensional concept view of Artica orbiting a blue dwarf and a red giant star. When you put on the neuroglove, flying from the deep space behind the stars came a tiny pyrean dressed in a long blue robe and a tall pointy hat.
'Ahh...you're back at long last, Master,' said the minuscule figure, stopping above Artica's frozen North Pole.
It glanced at you with a tiny smile and then stared at your hands as you meticulously groped the arms and legs of the teddy droid, trying to find something out of place or broken. Then it spoke in a disgruntled tone, 'Oh Master, must you really activate that helpless sack of joints?' it said, twiddling its tiny thumbs. 'It's just that I might have, accidentally of course, activated the wash program of the shower when he decided, quite unexpectedly I must add, to go look for you there, who knows why. And if you turn him on now ---'
'You did what?!' you interrupted. You tapped the power switch on the teddy droid's neck and a barely audible humming came from inside him.
'Me? Nothing! Not, a, thing, Master. It was simply a set of unfortunate circumstances that led, coincidentally I must emphasize, to a most unexpected accident.'
It had barely finished his sentence, when the teddy droid leapt from your hands, landed on the desk and stood tall and firm, pointing one furry paw at the tiny figure, 'YOU!' shrieked the teddy droid. 'You tricked me! If I hadn't deactivated when the water poured down on me it would have fried all my circuits!' he twisted round to look at you, jumped onto your lap and started to emit sounds that resembled sobbing, 'Master, do not leave me alone with him. He is mean.'
You gently patted its furry head, smiling in amusement, 'So, that's why I found you all drenched in the shower,' you looked at the figure's tiny dark eyes and frowned. 'That explains it, doesn't it, Evander?'
The miniature pyrean hid behind the blue and white planet, poking its head from one side of the Equator, 'Oh Master, it was just a little prank. But if you demand an explanation, then I must confess that it was the only solution I found to not having to hear his incessant queries regarding when you were coming back.'
'You see, Master?! You see how I suffer in your absence?' the teddy droid complained, staring at you while intently pointing at Evander.
You swung your hoverchair backwards and gently laid it on top of the bed, 'Don't worry, Hampy. He won't be harming you anymore. From now on you two are going to get along just fine,' you glanced at your host with harsh eyes. 'Am I right Evander?'
The miniature figure slowly came out from behind planet, taking off his tipped hat and hanging his head low, 'If I must, Master,' it said in a dejected voice. 'I will make sure to reprogram my interaction protocols with the Affection Support Droid to something more cordial the next time I restart my system. I will not perform it right away simply because I cannot bear the knowledge that I have done so, if you allow me, Master.'
You looked at him with concern and twisted your lips, 'I think I might have given you too much of a personality when I reprogrammed you.'
'That is nonsensical, master! You gave me just the right amount of personality that allows me to perform my functions efficiently,' he said, and in an authoritative stance he hastily added, 'And now it's time to call your caretaker.'
It was only then that you remembered that early in the morning you had scheduled a conversation with her. As you looked around, you realized she would be shocked by the sight of your room, 'Wait!' you yelped.
Evander popped out of the holoscreen and appeared right before your nose. 'My apologies, Master, but your caretaker is already waiting and her protocols overcome yours. I have granted you all the tolerance that my personality allows,' it said, throwing a malicious smile before vanishing.
The uplink was established almost immediately, giving you only the time to convey the thought to your holoscreens to replay random memories of you and your friends at the Academy. You clumsily tossed your green jacket over Hampy, who let out a muffled shriek just as the image of your caretaker replaced the concept view of Artica in the holoscreen. Her short dark hair was tucked behind her ears and she wore a white Specialist uniform with its silvery insignia of a dodecahedron at her chest. She was then, as much as she is now, youthful and well preserved. Her face was soft, yet her gaze was similar to no other: cold and inquiring brown eyes that examined every corner and nook of your room, jumping from the desk to the bed to the wardrobe before looking at you attentively.
...who is this pyrea...
'Salutations, Miriam,' you said, standing nervously next to your bed.
'Your room is untidy,' she stated bluntly.
'You know it is not easy to manage the residence on my own with all the indoctrinations at the Academy, and all the---uhh---' your voice faded into an imperceptible mumble.
'If you were to return to the residence at a proper time instead of fraternizing with your colleagues, you would have more than the time required to tidy up your bedroom, for the very least, Alan Balthazar,' she added.
Her statement was hard to disprove, even if relinquish friendship to have an organized room did not feel right to you, especially now, when they needed your help with the Gathering. You scratched your head, trying to find the best way to justify your lack of commitment, 'Well, tomorrow is---'
'I am aware that tomorrow is your Gathering,' she interrupted. 'And I am also aware that you caused a disturbance in History doctrine last week.'
A shiver ran down your spine and you had trouble swallowing.
'If it comes to my attention that your academic performance is below the rank needed to become a Specialist, you will find your remaining days as an apprentice to be the hardest of your entire career,' she said, and her cold penetrating stare rendered you incapable to reply. 'Furthermore, if you do not fulfill your domestic responsibilities before the Gathering, you are forbidden to attend it. You are about to become a citizen Alan Balthazar, I suggest you start acting like one.'
You felt like you had no option other to submit to her demand. Yet, even though she was being unfair, you knew she was merely concerned about your future, 'I will clean my room before the Gathering,' you said solemnly.
She looked directly at Hampy, whose hollow lenses were furtively peeping above your jacket, 'And I have already ordered you to surrender your Affection Support Droid for disassembly. Your age has long surpassed its usage. No self-respecting apprentice should have one, even less a citizen of Darm,' she said and looked away.
'Miriam, wait,' you said before she terminated the connection.
'Yes?' she said, looking at you again with her cold eyes.
'Is it true that the Project is nearing a cure for the Torment?' you asked.
'The current state of the Project does not concern an apprentice,' she answered. 'If you wish to know, I suggest you become a Specialist and earn full access to the Project segment.'
'Is that where Mother stores the research on the Torment?' you asked with curiosity.
'No more will I say about it. I must leave, and you must clean your room. I expect it to be clean when I return,' she said. 'Order ensures Progress.'
'When are you returning?' you asked in a hurry.
The connection ended abruptly, leaving you cheerless and tired. Still, a twinge of curiosity aroused you, and instead of going to bed, you opened a thought connection to Mother and inquired her about the Fundaments of Existence doctrine, for clues regarding the Torment. To your frustration, Mother presented endless topics related to the retrovirus but barely any related to the Torment, or a search for the cure. For a moment, you thought about giving up and going to bed, but then you remembered Miriam's last words and you realized that if you were able to gain access to the Project segment, you would know right away the state of the ongoing research and maybe find some explanation as to what mentor Elias said. 
You activated the desk holoprojector with the neuroglove and found your way into the Source, the hidden structure containing the nodes that comprised Mother's neural network. Shortly after, a vast network of green threads and blue cubes emerged above the desk.
Evander promptly popped into view on the holoscreen, his avatar much bigger than the previous, 'Master, Sleep Time has started, and you need every minute of it to re-establish your mental and physical capacities for a new day of indoctrination. Will you not cease your activities and go to sleep?'
'Evander go into suspension mode. I'll go to bed in a moment,' you said absentmindedly, your eyes locked on the Source.
'I do not find your tendency of breaking Directives to my liking, Master. Not one bit! It could end in serious, horrible, hideous problems for us, if Mother or Miriam were to find out. And they will, eventually. They will find out, and if they do---a' he stuttered in utter dismay, '---and when they do, what will become of me? I will be deactivated and left forgotten on a nanosheet, have my memory core completely---'
'Don't make me force you into suspension,' you muttered distractedly. 'It will be worse.'
The small avatar sighed and threw down his arms.
'All right, all right. Have a pleasant Sleep Time, Master,' he said and vanished.
The green threads floated above the desk holoprojector, climbing up and down, turning left and right as they formed a complex grid that extended to the borders of the projection. There was enough distance between them to allow you to make sense of their direction, and once you found a thread headed towards the Project segment you selected it, dipping your finger into the projection, and then followed its path along the Source.
As your finger progressed along the long threads, the network kept changing, branching left and right, up and down, in a seemingly infinite agglomerate of three-dimensional crossroads. At the center of the crossroads were red cubes, which you knew to be security protocols that Mother had in place to prevent any unauthorized access - such as yours. If you were to touch one, your access would be immediately barred, and your identity revealed to Her. Therefore, you never ran down one thread for too long, instead jumping up and down, left and right, from thread to thread and avoiding every intersection without having to change directions.
Like a cunning prey tirelessly dodging its unrelenting predators, you finally arrived at the Project segment. Before you were dozens of threads that led to blue cubes with numbers hovering above them, each of which stored a logical partition of information. For a moment, you wondered which cubes contained information about the research on the Torment. Before you could start searching, your grid-view was unexpectedly pulled to a massive array of parallel threads that ended in red cubes: you had inadvertently triggered a passive defense system and you were now speeding towards it without any way of slowing down. It loomed menacingly as you approached it, and for a moment it seemed that you could only avoid hitting it by terminating the connection.
'Activate evasion protocol and locate the nearest safe thread,' you quickly commanded the terminal using voice interaction.
A thread on the left view of the Source glowed in bright blue. Your finger jumped and jumped along the parallel threads headed towards the wall of red cubes, until you cleared the last thread, just before hitting its red cube. When your finger landed on the blue thread, you hastily tapped it along its path. A few moments later, you had left the cluster of threads and cubes that comprised the Project segment behind and were safely back into the main intersection that connected to all information paths.
'That was too close,' you said and sighed with relief.
Too tired for another attempt, you decided to stop for the day. 
The intricate threads of information disintegrated above the desk when you waved your neuroglove through them. You pushed the hoverchair backwards with your feet and jumped to the bed. 
You sank into its foamy mattress as it molded itself to the shape of your body, and when the room was immersed in darkness, you closed your eyes, hugging yourself to Hampy who had already powered off. Slowly, your Unit brought your brainwave pattern to frequencies associated with sleep, and as dreams slipped into your mind, your consciousness travelled to places far beyond your bedroom.
Eighth memory - Desperate Measures

''Several were the occasions in the past when one single individual was forced to choose between the lives of a few and the salvation of millions. When that choice fell upon me, I was forced to choose between the extinction of my kind and the end of time.''

An excerpt rescued from the final diary of Gadim: Contemplations regarding The End;


'Von Howitt,' said a sharp voice.
'Voice recognition successful. Have a pleasant and productive evening, Specialist Von Howitt,' said the soft voice of Mother.
The reinforced sliding-door that led to the containment wing opened with one quick jerk, releasing into the air the distinct odor of ether. Von Howitt took one deep breath and then calmly entered the dark and silenced corridor with a grim, attentive stare.
He heard the door close behind him as he walked along the ample wing flanked with lettered sealed doors on both walls. The ceiling and floor lit around him as he progressed along the corridor and dimmed behind him, lighting his steps in a smooth succession of spotlights until he stopped at the sealed door with the letter ''A''.
The door opened as soon as his forearm hovered above the touchscreen. Inside the short and narrow white room, was a girl lying gently on a smooth metal slab that extended from the wall. Von Howitt approached the slab, kneeled beside it, and cast a tender gaze over the girl's resting face. 
'Time to wake up, my dear,' he said with a gentle smile.
He was an aged Specialist with wrinkly face and gray hair, old enough for Honorable Retirement, whereas she was immaculate and young. Her short hair was as white as snow and her face as cool as a wintry morning; her chin was angular, her lips soft, her nose upright, and long snow-white eyebrows surmounted her closed eyes. She slowly opened them and looked at him attentively, seeming that she had been awake for a long time. Their color was of pure blue and they glowed like sapphires sunk in an unfathomable depth.
...I know these eyes...
'Let us go for a walk.' the Specialist said tenderly.
She gave him a simple nod and stood up. She was taller than the Specialist, who was a head shorter. On her slender body was a white exoderm stretching from her neck, down to her wrists and ankles, and around her neck was a thin metallic collar. After she gave him her hand, Von Howitt led her outside the room.
'This is a very special occasion,' he said, walking nervously alongside her towards the exit of the wing.
Her silence contrasted with the increasing unease in the Specialist's voice, 'You are about to perform an important trial that requires you to follow commands without raising questions.'
They exited the wing and entered a well-lit room with a round counter at the center.
Von Howitt walked up to it.
Inside the cabin was a civilian of a robust stature, wearing a white uniform with the dodecahedron insignia of a Specialist on his chest. He was focused on verifying data on the many holoscreens under the metallic counter and gave no sign of being aware of Von Howitt.
Beyond the counter was a curved permaglass door and beyond it was a deep white hallway filled with crossing corridors that abruptly ended in a distant wall. 
The curved door opened to the sides.
'The escort is awaiting ahead, Specialist Von Howitt,' the pyrean said, eyeing him attentively and then examining the girl. 'Standard procedures are in effect.'
'Certainly, Specialist Marlon,' said Von Howitt, and he led the girl through the door.
Confirming what the Specialist said, on the other side of the checkpoint was a dark oval shaped drone, hovering above the white ground. It hovered no higher than the Specialist's waist, and on top of its dark metal coating was a smoked permaglass dome that sheltered its sensory devices. When it acknowledged their presence, it emitted sounds in distinct frequencies spaced in small intervals, resembling a coded language.
Von Howitt understood what it was saying and when the drone stopped beeping, he answered, 'That won't be necessary, she is sedated.'
The drone beeped again, and its beeps were less spaced and faster, seeming that it was distressed with Von Howitt's reply.
'I will take full responsibility for any damage caused if control over the specimen is lost,' Von Howitt answered. 'Now, lead us to the observations room number thirteen.'
The escort answered with two loud beeps and hovered along the white corridor. Von Howitt followed it one meter behind, the girl alongside him, and as they moved, he cast an occasional sidelong glance through the windowed rooms along the corridor, the breeding chambers inside which new specimens were born. They were immersed in individual incubation tanks hermetically sealed to prevent outside contaminants filled with an amniotic solution that would protect and nurture the still developing fetuses. Inside one of them, a fully mature specimen was restlessly tapping its feet on the permaglass while from the outside a Specialist analyzed the data being displayed on the small holoscreen attached to the tank.
Exiting the level, they walked through an opened blast door and entered the entrance hall, the number ''313'' engraved on its wall. They stepped into a magtube and floated down.
...where are we...
At the underground levels of the Project Facility. It was inside these tightly secured corridors that the cure for the Torment was being conceived. The resulting specimens were bred, kept and observed beyond the knowledge of all but a few Specialists. If something were to go wrong with the procedures, the sturdy blast doors at the entrance would close and anyone inside would be sealed in, to forever remain buried in dark forgotten halls. Some levels below had had that gruesome fate and were now out of service. Throughout the years, many young Specialists were abandoned alive alongside rampaging specimens. Only in the worst of nightmares may you imagine the unspeakable horrors they suffered and the gruesome fate they met. But those are other memories altogether, better left forgotten than remembered...

Following the drone down one of the corridors, Von Howitt and the girl stopped near a sealed access door. Above it was a screen indicating ''Observations Room Nr. 13''. The Specialist dismissed the drone and - once he was sure it was out of sight - led the girl into the room. 
Sitting in front of a long metallic desk, burdened with several devices of different shapes and purposes, was a young Specialist stooping over a small transparent slide placed over a surface that irradiated light. He wore a pair of magnifying goggles, simple in shape, but highly effective for gazing at objects down to the nanometric scale, and he seemed to be tinkering with the slide, examining it closely and poking it with a pointy tweezers. It took him a while to turn his attention to Von Howitt and the girl, and when he looked at them with his magnifying goggles still on, his eyes were huge and disproportionate, slowly becoming smaller as the goggles adjusted themselves to the meter scale. When he managed to realize who had walked into the room, he flinched, his chair hovering backwards.
Von Howitt ignored him altogether. He locked the door, sat the girl in a hoverchair next to the desk, and then rushed into one of the desk drawers to rummage its contents. Nanosheets flew to the ground as his restless hands cleared the inside and pulled a metallic box which he then placed on the desk. He opened the box and removed from inside it a cylindrical object. It was smooth and utterly dark, and as he looked at it, it contracted and collapsed itself into a pair of pliers. Von Howitt was used to the transformation, and when he applied it to the girl's restrictive collar , the pliers' tips expanded and molded around the collar.
'This is going to hurt a little,' said Von Howitt in a tender voice.
It was only then that the bewildered young Specialist gathered the nerve to react. He stammered awkwardly, almost doubting his own words, 'Specimens are not allowed in Observation Rooms! You, you must not remove the collar!'
He made a sneaky attempt to grab his neurolink which was foolishly resting on the desk, but when his hand was upon it, Von Howitt's gripped his skinny forearm faster than his old age could tell.
'I advise you to stay very still, and be very quiet, Specialist Helmholtz,' said Von Howitt, giving him a menacing smile.
The young Specialist froze in shock when he heard the warning, his wide-open eyes growing to three times their size when Von Howitt loomed over his goggles. He nodded hastily, backed his hoverchair to a corner and sank in it.
Von Howitt quickly turned his attention to the girl. She was staring at him attentively.
'I won't harm him. He will be all right.' then he added, glancing back at the young Specialist, 'If he heeds my advice.'
He squeezed the trigger on the pliers and the collar broke loose from around her neck without the girl letting out so much as a moan. After throwing the collar to the ground, the pliers fused into a needle that Von Howitt applied to her neck and pricked her soft skin. Soon after, a green light blinked on the apparatus' small screen. Von Howitt allowed himself a gentle smile. Then he stood up, grimacing from an old back ache, and stretched out one hand to her.
'Shall we?' he said.
She nodded and gave him one hand.
Von Howitt unlocked the door, waving his forearm over the touchscreen, and before exiting the Observations Room he picked up the neurolink on the desk and turned to the young Specialist who was still in one corner of the room, staring at them in shock.
'It is best that you wait here a few minutes before you leave to the surface. I advise you not to contact Mother in the meantime.'
He carried on in hasty footsteps, leading the girl to the magtubes at the end of the long silent corridor, flanked by dark intersections and ominously sealed doors. Von Howitt struggled to keep up the pace, always turning back to check if no one or nothing was following them as they approached the end. And it was precisely at the end of the white corridor, past its blast door, that he almost rammed into two tall pyreans when turning on the last intersection. He staggered backwards when he recognized them, cursing his ill fortune.
Blocking his last meters to the exit hall were two Acolytes. These were initiates of the Council's representatives, and ever did they wait for an opportunity to prove themselves to their Mentalists and achieve the higher status of Overseer. They both were very much alike: tall, scrawny and dull, with bright, shiny bald heads that glistened from the ceiling lamps light; and they both wore their long crimson mantles, pressed and spotless, adorned with two thin bronze stripes that fell from their frail shoulders to the floor.
They both greeted him with a short bow, ignoring the girl altogether:
'Salutations, Specialist Von Howitt,' said one with the distinctive dull voice of a Council representative. 'I am Byrne and I represent Mentalist Faust.'
'As you are aware, the Council of Mentalists is impressed with your contributions to the Project,' said the other with an identical dull voice. 'I am Bourne and I represent Mentalist Faust.'
'Mentalist Faust is particularly impressed with the progress you have made with specimen A,' added Byrne, glancing at the girl as if she were merely an object; she kept looking down as Von Howitt had instructed her. 'It is written on your last report that during all trials, she did not take action unless commanded and obeyed every command without developing an emotional response.'
'Mentalist Faust has requested that we observe the scheduled experiment,' said Bourne. 'If your findings are correct, she might prove to be stable enough for the next phase. 
Byrne was intently staring at Von Howitt, studying his reactions, reading his thoughts. Von Howitt tried his best to clear his mind until an adequate reasoning would unconsciously arise.
'We are on time, are we not?' the Acolyte asked, intrigued by the long pause.
 Von Howitt cast a sudden cordial smile at Byrne, 'Certainly, Acolytes. Please follow me to the Observations Room.'
He led them across the exit hall, walking past the stairwell access door and the magtubes without so much as thinking about them. He then crossed under another bulky blast door back into another main corridor and soon after, he stopped at the entrance to Test Chamber number one, which was adjacent to the corresponding Observations Room. After authenticating his clearance on the touchscreen, the door opened to a small Sterilization Chamber. It had two mirrored windows on each side and was filled with showerheads on the ceiling. Opposite the entrance, was the airtight door that led to the chamber.
Raising one hand, Von Howitt invited them in.
The two Acolytes gazed into the tight Sterilization chamber and then cast a dubious gaze at Von Howitt.
'What is the purpose of entering the Test Chamber?' Bourne asked, while Byrne stared intently at Von Howitt.
'I find that observing specimens closely is far more instructive than behind a reinforced wall,' Von Howitt promptly answered, preventing his mind from thinking anything else. 'It is quite safe. And as I have mentioned on my report, she does not take action unless commanded.'
Bourne turned his head and looked at Byrne. Byrne looked back at him and then both turned their heads towards Von Howitt.
An eerie silence followed...
'Very well,' they both agreed.
Von Howitt stretched out his hand again and invited them to enter first, intently thinking about their higher status.
'I grant you entrance,' he said, his head bowing low.
Byrne nodded and entered with his head proudly raised. Bourne was next, but for a reason he never understood, he glanced at the girl just as he was stepping inside and realized that she was not wearing a restrictive collar. He stopped, halfway in halfway out, and stared inexpressively at Von Howitt. He then asked, and his tone was more demanding, seeming that an irrefutable command was being given:
'You will tell us Specialist Von Howitt, why this specimen is not wearing a restrictive collar.'
Von Howitt gazed at them both, silently, struggling to disobey the command. When he could resist no more, he answered firmly, 'Because I removed it.'
He had barely spoken when with all the strength he could muster he pushed Bourne into the chamber with such force that he crashed against Byrne and they both fell on the metallic floor with sound oompfs!
He quickly pressed the ''Emergency Close'' icon on the touchscreen and the door sealed itself in a split-second.
He had trapped them inside the Sterilization Chamber, for it had no touchscreen from the inside, but no door would keep them trapped for long, he knew. So, he grabbed the girl's hand, ran down the corridor and crossed under the opened blast door as fast as his age allowed, rushing into the exit hall towards the magtubes.
When he was just about to step into the bottomless shaft, the cylindrical door sealed in his face. Von Howitt turned around in dismay, only to see the blast doors hastily shut at the same time. In the blink of an eye the bright white exit hall eclipsed into a foreboding darkness. Red lights flashed from emergency lamps that were lowered from the ceiling, tinting the sealed hall in the warm color of blood.
Then, a slow alarm erupted. Its notes spread through the hall, resonated on its walls, and reached Von Howitt's ears, echoing in desperation.
With a jolt he spun around and repeatedly passed his Unit over the magtube touchscreen. ''Security breach on level minus ten: Containment procedures engaged.'' sounded Mother's stark warning throughout the condemned hall. Then he quickly ran to the adjacent door that led to the stairwell and introduced the Emergency Override code on the touchscreen. At his first attempt, the blue control panel turned red, flashing with the words ''Access denied: Lockdown engaged.''
He bashed the door in frustration. One meager centimeter of impermium was all that stood between them and their slow demise, but it was more than enough, he knew.
'There is nothing I can do,' he said gloomily. At a loss to think or act, he turned to the girl and wrapped his inconsolable arms around her.
'I am sorry my dear, I cannot get us out,' he said despondently. 'I am afraid we will be trapped here for a long, long time.'
The girl's only response was an unconcerned blue-eyed stare.
Von Howitt surrendered himself to a quiet lament, ceaselessly disturbed by the cadence of the alarm. And it was to that fateful sound, and immersed in despair, that he wished the door would open.
An impetuous force smashed against the solid impermium with a loud clank that overlapped the sound of the alarm. 
With a fright, Von Howitt raised his head and looked at the door. It seemed to have resisted whatever hit it. He calmly backed off, grabbing the girl's hand.
An even louder clamor bellowed through the hall when another force hammered the unyielding door, which resisted once again before his intimidated stare. He dreaded for whoever was trying to get in, since he knew whoever it was, they were most likely coming for them. Without any warning, the door started to open on one side, cracking, shrieking, buckling, as its brakes and binders attempted to keep it sealed. When it stopped, the door had yielded to the length of a narrow slit just wide enough for a pyrean to squeeze through.
Von Howitt looked through the gap. On the stairwell at the other side, a still, dark quietness welcomed them in. He stared at the girl and saw a dim glow fading from her blue eyes.
'Was that you?' he asked, his voice filled with wonder.
The girl gently nodded, keeping her inexpressive stare.
Von Howitt's face lit with an old wrinkly smile. 'You never cease to amaze me.' Grateful, he kissed her forehead and spoke, 'Let us leave, quickly!'
Once he crossed the slit, he led the girl up the stairwell, never looking back. And as he fled from what could have been his tomb he heard the door behind hastily seal itself again. Of the fate of the two Acolytes and the young Specialist, nothing was ever said, and they wound remain in that tomb, forevermore.

...he could have commanded her to open the door...
He could have, but he would not dare, for he had made a vow to never control her again. The thought of assuming control of her was too abominable for him, even if to those he was trying to escape from she was the perfect instrument of creation, and destruction...

***

A great double-door bathed in gold was swung open into an ample round chamber. The strong radiance coming from outside revealed at the entrance a tall pyrean bearing a mantle with two gleaming silver stripes on each shoulder. The face was hidden in darkness as the figure bowed his bald head.
'An incident is in progress in the Project facility. Specialist Von Howitt is attempting to escape with specimen A,' said a male voice said in a monotonous tone.
'I am aware,' said a calm voice coming from inside. 'Measures are being taken. You may leave.'
'By your will,' said the pyrean before leaving.
As slowly and silently as they had opened, the doors were closed, rendering the chamber to a silent gloom.
'As it was meant to be,' the voice muttered.
It was coming from a figure looming above an ample semicircle desk that stood in front of a round window; beyond it was the darkened skyline of Darm. He was at the highest levels of Netcore, a privilege granted only to those who were part of the Council of Mentalists. His long crimson mantle spanned from a crimson carpet up to a wide tall collar that covered his nape. On his shoulders were two golden stripes that stretched down to his feet. He had short gray hair, apart from the top of his head which was bald and had a pale complexion. He was a Mentalist, one of the seven that formed the Council of Mentalists, governors of Darm. 
'Wollen, meet me at the entrance. Boros will come as well,' he commanded. His voice was smooth and sharp, seeming untainted by age or sickness. Whoever listened to it felt it as compelling as the entrancing murmur of a hypnotist; it stripped all the surroundings and ensnared the listener's undivided attention.
Floating above the desk, was the holoprojection of a pyrean with a maimed face. He was not something that had ever been seen by a darmian, one whose existence had not yet been terminated, that is. He was a cybernetic organism, a blend of life and machinery. Half of his deformed face was covered with a metallic plate and a dark monocle sprouted from his decayed flesh in the place of a left eye. Its reddish lips were chapped, covering pointy and rotten teeth. His voice was the opposite of that of the Mentalist's.
'We will meet you there, Master,' he said, and his voice was vicious and unnatural, as if all the foulness in the world had corrupted him.
The connection was severed, and his heinous face disappeared. 
In one swift movement, the crimson figure turned to leave the chamber. 'So predictable,' he said before leaving his quarters.

...who is this Mentalist...
He is Vittas, and he is responsible for all the harm that befell upon you during your time in Darm. But the harm he would soon inflict would be upon the unsuspecting Specialist escorting the specimen to freedom.

***

'We are almost there,' said Von Howitt to the girl as he panted up the stairwell. A restless screech of a locking mechanism came to his ears like a chime of hope as he climbed the last flight of stairs.
He and the girl had reached the minus one level of the Project Facility, where its access door had been craftily blocked with a metallic beam that had been pre-emptively placed on the frame to prevent the sliding-door from closing. They entered the chamber and the Specialist removed the beam, allowing the door to shut itself.
After crossing the access hall where the magtube entrance stood, they entered a dark broad chamber and quickly became surrounded by a loud cacophony of machinery at work. They were in one of the maintenance chambers of the facility and it was filled with an assortment of rumbling pumps, droning hydrogen engines, water tanks and steaming tubes that erupted from the machinery, climbed the walls, and pierced through the ceiling and flooring. Von Howitt navigated his way across the machinery until he and the girl arrived at the other end of the chamber, where a decommissioned service entrance four meters wide and two meters tall connected directly to the exterior. The impermium door was firmly sealed, its touchscreen deactivated, and by the look of its sturdy constitution, it would not seem possible to open it with mere strength.
He led the girl towards the coolant pump closest to the entrance, which was tirelessly working to pump liquid Helium to every laboratory in the facility. Stopping before its interface, he turned to the girl, 'My dear, you will wait here. When I ask you to open the coolant drain valve you will press the override icon on this touchscreen and then you will wait for my command to close it. Do you accept my request?' he asked the girl and smiled kindly.
She nodded innocently.
Von Howitt grabbed a pair of gloves from a tool booth next to the entrance, disappeared into a gap behind the ice crusted pump and the wall, and came back holding the metallic edge of a long hose that was attached to the coolant pump. He then dragged the weighty hose towards the service entrance, stopping ten feet away from it.
'Open the valve,' he shouted above the ruckus, pointing the hose to the service entrance and keeping himself at a safe distance.
The girl nodded.
When she pressed the icon, a warning flashed through the pump's small touchscreen: ''Danger: Liquid Helium drain valve activated.''
The girl pressed the override sensor below the status display, and after a rumbling sound, a torrent of ice came coursing from the pump's drainpipe and through the outer layer of the hose, condensing the air in clouds of vapor as it headed towards the nozzle held by Von Howitt. The liquid burst haphazardly against the door and the vapor produced from the thermal shock enveloped the room in a dense mist that devoured the entire floor and quickly rose up to his knees. Gushing from the nozzle and splattering upon the door, it froze the resilient impermium and once it started to spread dangerously close to his feet, Von Howitt asked the girl to close the drain valve. 
The drainage slowly came to a halt. When the mist subsided, the indestructible door was but a frozen block of metal. 
The hose disappeared in the lingering mist when Von Howitt threw it to the floor. He removed the gloves and ran to a tool board overlapping the wall of the small booth. With much effort he picked up the biggest and most robust wrench. Its heaviness matched its sturdiness for it was made from an outdated compound of steel - it was resistant but needlessly heavy. However, for the extraordinary circumstance, its weight suited Von Howitt all too well.
He ran to the frozen door with steadfast resolve and smashed! the wrench against it with all his strength. The impact released a loud metallic clang. As if it was made of ice, the frozen surface shattered into a thousand pieces that played a chaotic symphony of bright notes as they fell randomly on the mist-filled floor.
At the point of impact, a shallow crater was dug in the thick layer of impermium. Almost immediately, Mother's voice sounded between the rumbling noises of the machinery: ''Security breach in the maintenance level: Containment procedures engaged.'' 
The warning of Mother roused a desperate sense of urgency in Von Howitt. He cocked the wrench as far back as he could and uncoiling his hips he threw the wrench at the dented door, shattering the remainder of the layer with an unstoppable momentum and tearing a gap wide enough to cross, as the frozen shards of metal fell on the floor.
Silence followed, and from the gap that had been carved, came the cold dark breeze of the night outside.
From the outside, a pyrean peered into the chamber, frantically turning his head as he attempted to discern anything through the vapor that escaped to the cold atmosphere. When he recognized Von Howitt's wrinkly face, he said nervously, 'Joseph! Stalkers have already been deployed! We must hurry!'
 Von Howitt turned his stern gaze to the girl, who stood calmly beside him, ever watching, ever listening, and spoke in a grave tone, 'My dear, since your birth I took care of you as a father would a daughter. I watched with pride as you grew to become the lovely girl you are today. My only wish was that I could look after you in a place far from harm, but that will remain a wish forever,' he said, and his eyes moistened with sadness. 'Now, I can but be content with the knowledge that I have done all I can to help you reach that place.'
'Joseph, we must leave!' said the pyrean outside, stretching out his arm.
Von Howitt calmy spoke to the girl, 'This is Nicholas. He is a reliable friend, and he will guide you there. I send you to a cold dangerous world, but I have taught you everything that will allow you to survive. Now go and be safe, this is my last request.'
'Yes, Specialist Von Howitt,' she answered softly.
He kissed her forehead and watched her leave through the gap on the shattered door, with the help of Nicholas.
Then, Nicholas stretched out his arm to Von Howitt, 'Please, hurry.'
Von Howitt did not move, 'I will buy you some time from this side. It falls onto you to lead her to safety. Do not let them take her,' he pleaded. 'For her sake, and for the sake of us all.'
Nicholas gave him a grim stare, 'I will do my best,' he answered and leaned away from the gap. 
Under the roofless night, shadowed by the tall dark facade of the facility, he pulled a belt from his backpack and tied it to the girl's waist.
'This is a Radiation Dispersion Device ,' he said to her. 'With it, we will pass unnoticed by the stalkers' sensors,' he then removed a pair of dark glasses and placed them on her nose and ears. 'These are spectral lenses. They will allow you to see through the dispersion field.'
The girl looked inside the gap in the door, and with a calm innocent voice spoke, 'I bid my leave, Specialist Von Howitt.'
'Be safe,' he said.
A single tear rolled down his cheek, as his feelings grew to a level he believed they would never grow again. It was the last time he would see her, and he felt terribly sad, yet he could not cry. His emotions were all but dried up and all that he could give her was a saddened stare.
'It has been a privilege, Joseph,' said Nicholas, as his body slowly faded into air.
'It has been a privilege,' Von Howitt repeated as they vanished.

Slowly, he turned his back, walking past the machines in short broken steps and into the access hall. He heard the distinct droning sound of the magtube hovering somebody inside it. He turned to it and waited, and watched, and listened. 
The sliding door opened.
The first things that stepped out were two dreadful creatures made of metal and flesh, whose maimed faces twisted into eerie smiles once they saw the Specialist. Calmly stepping out behind them, far more appealing but no less intimidating, was a Mentalist bearing his crimson mantle and golden stripes falling down each shoulder. His grey eyes gazed upon the Specialist and his thin lips trembled with satisfaction.
'Vittas,' Von Howitt softly muttered in his last breath.
He suddenly felt his limbs falter from head to toe. His body fell to the floor, his eyes opened wide, his face filled with helpless wonder.
Silence came about him.
Darkness overtook him.
And the insipid taste of death became his last memory, as his consciousness slipped away into nothingness.

...why have you shown me this...
I have brought you to see these memories so that you may better understand what I am to show you next. For it was during this night, while you lay in sleep, that Joseph Von Howitt, a pyrean you never came to know, sacrificed his life to free the one that would give purpose to yours.
Ninth memory - Of young and old ancestors

[...] Apart from the Panoramic Transports there shall be three other transportation devices in the metropolis. To avoid traffic overload at surface level, every cargo that requires transportation shall be sent through the Underground Translocation Network. The principles for teleportation using quantum entanglement and quantum computing have long been discovered, yet we are still unable to apply them to any sentient organism without terminating its existence. Given that no organic life shall travel through it, this network will be equipped with Matter Translocation Devices which will act in principle as teleporters, disintegrating non-organic objects and transporting their particles through underground conduits to the Materialization Chambers located in every building on Darm, which will rematerialize them into their original form. The second and third transportation devices shall be the glider and the hoverboard. These shall be personal hovering transports, the gliders granted to citizens, the hoverboards granted to apprentices, and they shall be used at their own discretion, given that they confine their travels to the paths built for that purpose and not breach the Directives regarding proper use of transportation devices.

An excerpt from Annex #23: Cargo and personal transportation devices;
Division of Urban Planning under the authority of Mentalist Torval;


The carefully measured dosage of sleep antagonists released into your bloodstream woke you up and brought you almost immediately to a mild alertness. You slowly opened your eyes, lazily stretched out your arms and raised yourself to a sitting position. 
The shading effect of the window was lowered to ten percent, allowing the first rays of Mithras to seep into your room and bathe you with its soft warm light. 
Out of nothing, the small avatar of Evander popped before your nose.
'Good morning, Master!' said a loud cheerful voice. 'Ready for yet another brilliant day of indoctrination, study and productivity?'
'Not really,' you muttered drowsily while you scraped sticky secretions off your eyes.
You looked down to your left and saw Hampy sitting at your side on the foamy mattress, looking up at you with as big of a cheerful expression as was possible for an automated robot. You patted his head and yawned.
'Come, now!' Evander cheered. 'The weather is sublime, and the forecast is an entire day of clear blue sky. As clear and blue as clear and blue can be, If I might add!'
When you realized what day it was, you sprang lively to your feet. 
'You're right!' you said.
Evander orbited around you at a dizzying speed. 'That's the attitude!'
You walked up to the wardrobe imbued on the wall and opened it, removing a pair of pants and a jacket from two separate drawers, and hastily put them on top of your exoderm. As you rushed, you dropped the jacket from the previous day on the floor. Hampy had stored it aside for cleaning and he yelped in anguish when he saw it on the carpet.
'My apologies,' you said courteously and picked up the jacket.
After clasping the magnets that held your uniform firmly pressed against your body, you said before leaving the room, 'Take care of each other.'
'Have a nice day, Master,' they both answered in unison.
As you descended the staircase to the entrance hall, you issued your Unit to establish a thought connection with Haji. Immediately after receiving the confirmation, you heard Haji's voice in your mind, 'We are almost at the sixth platform.'
'I am on my way,' you conveyed the thought.
'You should make haste or else you will arrive late at the indoctrination,' Haji answered.
'I'll catch up with you soon,' you conveyed the thought. 
You were just about to exit the residence when you glanced to the left. There, standing forgotten against the corner next to the sealed door was you hoverboard. Your eyes kindled with excitement. 'On second thought, I have a better idea. See you at the Academy.'
Haji guessed your idea, 'You are very fortunate. Mother still does not allow me to ride mine after our last incident. Don't do anything foolish. The hoverlanes are filled with gliders today.'
You grinned mischievously. 
'I will try not to,' was the last thought you conveyed to him.

Evander's description of the weather had been accurate. Not a single cloud was in the sky, and the thick snow that had claimed most of the white sidewalks during the night was now withdrawing to the bottom of the picket fences of the residences, where long white rows of ice melted in the morning rays.
The warm humming of your hoverboard echoed off your street, as you slowly hovered between the residences. The air was fresh and clear. From time to time, small blocks of snow fell from the residences when the breeze blew harder.
Once you reached one of the streets that led to the East Boulevard, you came across a long file of citizens standing on top of their gliders, filling the hoverlane in an orderly and patient manner - too patient for your liking. Their gliders were hardly impelling them forward, rather standing motionless one decimeter above the metallic lane as they leaned over the handles extending from the glider's round base to their waists.
Moments after, as you joined the sluggish line, anxiety began to churn your stomach. 'If I stay here any longer, I will miss the indoctrination,' you muttered to yourself.
You held on to that thought as you turned left on a perpendicular street. You hovered down a quiet block of residences and when you reached its end the result was the same: yet another hoverlane filled with yet another line of gliders listing lazily to the weight of their operators.
...the cloisters...go through the cloisters...
You crouched, set the eternium coils of your hoverboard to maximum power, and hopped out of the hoverlane, crossing the marble walkway into a small alleyway that led to a cloister, the large, enclosed area within a block of residences whose purpose was to allow its residents to relax outdoors, sitting on benches or strolling around its fountain. At this point, you were relying on the eternium field generated by your hoverboard to impel you through the magnetic fields generated by the Magnetization Towers, something a standard hoverboard was not powerful enough to do, but yours and Haji's were more than capable, after the few unofficial modifications you made to their capacitors, that is. The sole drawback was that, under too much strain, they could very well blow up at your feet and rocket you to the sky. However, that was something you hoped would never happen. Fortunately, it never did.
A cunning smile was outlined on your lips once you entered the cloister and realized it was empty as you had expected. You slowed down to a halt and activated the Thought Recognition Protocol of your Unit. You closed your eyes and conveyed a thought to it, 'Chart nearest course to the Eastern entrance of the Hub. Set path between cloisters and alleyways. Display map trajectory including location of every darmian within a thirty meter radius.'
You heard Mother's voice in your mind, ''Plot established. Conveying image to occipital lobe.''
An impalpable transparent map materialized before your eyes, overlapping the surroundings. On the upper left corner of the map, a compass with the North and South Magnetization Towers as its poles signaled your position relative to the metropolis. You turned yourself to the course along the snowy cloister, pointed to the narrow alleyway fifty meters ahead and leaned forward on the hoverboard while pressing its magnetic brakes with your heels. It started buzzing furiously. If it were teeming with anticipation or about to explode you could not tell. 
You remembered your friend's warning and your smile widened to a wicked grin. 'No point on riding a hoverboard if we can't have some fun.'
Just when you were about to fall over, you lifted your heels and the hoverboard took off in a flash. The acceleration was so intense than you were brought you to your knees as you darted through the cloister, into the alleyway, flying across the street like a sudden gust of wind and entering the next alleyway. You lifted yourself with great effort and struggled to keep your balance as you buzzed across a second and a third street, leaving a trail of snow behind. Tiny specks of water flew at your facemask when you passed the water fountains at the center of the cloisters and as you entered the fourth, on the shuddering map before you a thin wall of blue dots signaling gliders was displayed on the approaching street along with separated green dots of citizens on foot. Your better judgment urged you to slow down, but you were too excited to consider the consequences of colliding with citizen, although you had the presence of mind to conclude it involved a lot of pain. You sighted the street through the narrow alley ahead just as a citizen dressed in yellow crossed it. You quickly guessed the trajectory between the blue dots, crouched on the hoverboard, toughened your muscles and clutched your jaw and fists.
'There!'
In a roaring buzz the hoverboard bolted between two gliders, blindsiding their operators and throwing them to the ground. Before they even knew what had passed through you entered the next cloister leaving behind nothing but a cloud of snow.
You panted and trembled with excitement as your Unit warned you that a dangerous rush of adrenaline had been released into your bloodstream, suggesting a dosage of sedatives to counter the effect. You disregarded the suggestion and lowered your speed to half, struggling to calm yourself down. 
'That was close,' you said while trying to catch your breath.
Nearing the entrance to the East Boulevard, you received a message from Haji notifying you that something very unusual was happening at the Hub and it was best to be cautious. As you looked at the almost static columns of gliders pouring out from the streets and into the boulevard, you concluded that you had saved a fair amount of time. So, you decided to follow Haji's advice.
You stopped and dismounted from the hoverboard, placed it under your right arm and followed on foot, leisurely entering the Boulevard and walking along other citizens. There was an unusually high influx of citizens crowding the Boulevard, and as you gazed down towards the Hub, you noticed four long lines of citizens that stretched down the avenue. To your surprise, you saw that next to the tall ducts of the Air Intake Field surrounding the access to the Hub, the entry had been blocked by a tall plasma barrier . It seemed like a thin layer of undulating water, transparent and blue, and detachments of sentinels were supervising four narrow arch-like holes in it, where the lines of citizens slowly entered and exited the Hub. 
'No way...' you muttered to yourself, realizing that you would not get the indoctrination on time.
Impatiently jumping behind one of the lengthy queues of citizens, you began to wonder the consequences of arriving late. As far as you could recollect, there had not been any occasion where an apprentice arrived late at the academy, or any other darmian at their occupation for that matter. Darm was designed to be the most efficient system ever made. To that end, darmians had been trained at young age to follow the Directives as orderly as possible, and the Unit ensured that their metabolism was always kept in perfect balance. It was through that order, that progress was ensured. Still, it was the most unusual morning there was any memory of. You looked around you, trying to find some clue as to what was happening, and as you sluggishly followed the line down the Boulevard, you noticed an unusual glitter on the floor inside the Air Intake Field to your right.
...I know that bracelet...
Captivated by the reflection of the Mithras's light upon it, you stepped out of the line and approached the waist-high wall as casually as you could. You examined the small object from a distance. It was a small piece of metal connected to a strip. You thought for a second if whatever it was, was worth stepping inside the Air Intake Field and breach the Directives with so many citizens behind you. Then again, you thought it could offer some clue as to what was happening. You looked over your shoulder, to the queue you had just left. They seemed entirely absorbed in their effort to orderly walk towards the access point, as if they lacked any other purpose than entering the Hub. 
...go inside and pick it up...
No darmian in their sound judgment would enter an Air Intake Field, deliberately or not. But you felt so strangely compelled to that object, that without any other thought, you stepped over the fence and picked it up, only to quickly step back into the Boulevard. You clasped the object in your hand and returned to the orderly line. It seemed as if no one even noticed you, except for the citizen behind you, who gave you a surprised stare when you stepped in front of her. 
From your Unit's passive identifier, you knew her to be administrator Celine.
'My apologies, administrator Celine. I dropped something and am returning to the line,' you said, hoping she would leave the matter at that.
'Apology accepted. You may stay in front of me. Order ensures progress, apprentice Balthazar' said the middle aged pyrea and bowed.
'Order ensures progress, administrator Celine,' you returned the gesture and breathed a sigh of relief after you faced forward.
Holding the object as you followed the queue, you felt it soft to the touch. When you discretely opened your hand to examine it, you saw it was a thin and short white strip made of an elastic material. Firmly bound to it was a small metallic plate with the letter ''A''. On the edges of the strip, were the two ends of a magnetic clasp, both stamped with a smooth ellipse. When you tried the strip around your wrist you realized that when the clasps connected the two ellipses formed a prone 8.
...infinity...
With your thoughts wrapped around that image, you bumped against something soft.
When you looked up, you saw a tall middle aged darmian peering down at you wearing a white uniform. 'Pushing a citizen is considered a breach of the Directives for proper conduct, apprentice Balthazar,' he remarked, his apathetic stare revealing some indifference, yet his voice imprinted with subtle indignation. 'Were you not informed of that at the Academy?'
You identified his name through his Unit's signature and answered calmly while discretely stashing the elastic bracelet inside your utility belt, 'My apologies, Specialist Phelps. I was not aware that the line had stopped moving.'
Keeping his apathetic stare, the citizen answered before dismissing himself with a bow, 'Apology accepted. I understand that your distraction was a consequence of this exceptional delay. Order ensures Progress, apprentice Balthazar.'
'Order ensures Progress, administrator Phelps,' you answered bowing.
Like everyone else, you decided to pay attention to the queue in front to avoid drawing more attention to yourself. You secured the hoverboard under your right arm, and after waiting for your turn, a while that lasted less than you had anticipated, you crossed the checkpoint between the two rows of blue tinted sentinels, which examined you from top to bottom using their sensors, hidden beneath their featureless visors. They bore no weaponry of any sort - for their purpose was solely to be Mother's eyes and ears - but they were resilient, protected by an impervious layer of graphene from thin feet to light head. On their chest, they bore a silver insignia stamped with the golden tetrahedron, the Darmian Security Division symbol. 
Crossing between the rows of sentinels, you asked them for the reason behind the heightened security, but they did not answer. They were following Mother's protocol in silence.

Inside the Hub, security was even heavier. The bright clinking and clanking of the clockwork march of metallic feet could be heard on every walkway of every lane, while a few dozen meters above the D.S.D. drones ferreted the Hub with their infallible sensors.
With no time to ponder the reason for such scrutiny, you rushed past the entrance to the Academy. After crossing the front courtyard and entering the vast empty hallway, you stored the hoverboard on an automated shelf near the entrance and headed straight for your indoctrination room. 
When you entered, you interrupted mentor Gordon who was explaining the current situation to the filled room. He was a relatively young citizen of medium stature and a peculiar long face. His violet jacket was pressed tightly around his neck and his neurolink was perched on one of his big ears. You bowed silently and sat down.
'As I was saying,' he resumed disquietingly loud, 'Mentalist Vittas instructed us to clarify to you the circumstances concerning the plasma barrier around the Hub,' he paused and then resumed in an eloquent manner, for he had rehearsed the speech before the indoctrination. 'This past evening, a Torment outbreak occurred in one of the Project Facility laboratories. Mother promptly engaged her security measures and sealed the facility, but, after a thorough search, She determined that two Specialists were missing. Presently, they are still unaccounted for, and there is a chance that they are under the effects of the Torment.'
The apprentices began muttering anxiously, slowly filling the indoctrination room with a loud commotion.
'Apprentices, I urge you to remain calm,' the mentor instructed raising his voice.
The indoctrination room was instantly muted. Darmians suffering manifestations was a grave and unprecedented event, but they knew better than to lose formality. Concern filled every face, except yours. You were listening calmly, pondering the implications for yourself.
The mentor placed his hands behind his back and resumed as calm as ever, 
'Please bear in mind that all measures are being implemented to find and bring to safe observation these two citizens of Darm. As it is plain to see, the Hub is under containment and is being thoroughly searched by Mother's esteemed Darmian Security Division. She ensures us that they are confined to the Hub and that they will be found. If you paid close attention to your Citizen's Directives doctrine you are more than prepared for circumstances such as this, and if you paid close attention to the Fundaments of Existence doctrine you are also aware that any manifestation, if not prolonged, is entirely reversible. Rest assured that there is no reason for alarm and Darm will continue to operate with order. Our Guiding Father guarantees that the Torment does not affect us as long as we follow his Directives.'
You did not resist the urge to ask, 'How can he guarantee that?'
Mentor Gordon had anticipated that question. He straightened himself up, becoming statue as solemn as those seen on a fountain. Then he added emphatically, 'If you follow the Directives, you will not be affected by the Torment.'
...deception upon deception...every darmian under his sway...how he fooled them so well...
It is true that Gadim accomplished his vision under the veil of deception. But he only did what he thought best for the salvation of your kind. And to some extent, his device protected the Pyre from the ailment that afflicted all life.
...at the cost of freedom...
'So, the Specialists breached the Directives?' you asked with doubt. You had breached the Directives on a few occasions and had yet to suffer any manifestation.
Mentor Gordon gave you a stern look, 'That is yet to be determined and is not the subject of this announcement, apprentice Balthazar. I say again, rest assured that you are entirely safe and at liberty to proceed with your activities. The plasma barrier encircling the Hub is merely a precautionary measure that might prove to be entirely unnecessary. The Specialists will be found and treated,' he said, and without allowing time for more questions added, 'and now we shall start our Demography indoctrination, we have lost enough time as it is,' he straightened his jacket and continued in a formal tone, 'Who amongst you wishes to begin?'
Standing tall above the dais, he peered at his worried apprentices to find one eager to answer, until his eyes locked with yours. You hastily turned your attention to your neuropad in a futile attempt to demonstrate that you were busily conveying thoughts to it.
He smiled, 'Apprentice Balthazar,' he called out, and in his tone was a subtle satisfaction. 'Do you care to begin?'
Hearing your name stung you painfully. You grimaced and then gave him a solemn stare, 'My apologies, mentor Gordon, but I have not prepared today's indoctrination.'
A thin smile was cast upon the mentor's tall face. 'What a shame. Apparently, your ability to intervene in this doctrine does not stretch beyond inappropriate questions. Fifty credits removed for failing to accomplish the assigned task, and for arriving late.'
The removal of credits was automatically performed and privately notified by Mother. For that reason, his purpose in announcing it aloud was easily made clear to you: to shame you in front of your colleagues for your impertinence. You lowered your head, grieved by the penalty. It was a substantial amount and would damage your standing.
He then ignored you altogether and asked the class once more who wished to begin.
'I can begin, mentor Gordon,' Heidi said timidly, alarmed by the mentor's harshness towards you.
The mentor nodded, flashing a smile.
'Amardan was the name given to a native tribe located in the boreal region of the Western Continent. There are no accurate measures of the prevailing numbers, but it is believed that they have all disappeared. They inhabited the lower canyons of the Cloven Plateaus, which consists of a complex system of plateaus. Orbital scans over the Cloven Plateaus suggest that their primary settlement was located on the margins of the river Fresca.'
'Very well,' the mentor interrupted. 'Anyone care to continue?'
After Samuel and Sophie completed Heidi's presentation, mentor Gordon progressed to addressing the peculiarity of the inhabitants of Amardan. He began by explaining that their physical appearance was markedly different from a pyrean, and had been caused by the Torment and the geographical isolation that subjected them to the relentless frozen winds of the Boreal Glaciers during thousands of years:
'When the temperatures became far too cold to withstand, they were forced to migrate further to the south of the Cloven Plateaus and after establishing a new settlement, their explorations led them to a route through the canyons, down to the northern lands of the Western Continent. They were immediately dreaded by the outlying settlements of pyreans as they soon proved to be wild and ruthless. After a succession of incidents that led to the destruction of many pyrean settlements, the pyreans were successful in driving them back to the Cloven Plateaus during the Starvation Years. They were given the name odyr , a name apparently derived from the native language, which means essentially ''big woolly pyreans''.'
...I have heard of these creatures...but I have never found one...
They were real as they are still, although how they were depicted in this indoctrination was not the most accurate of accounts, to say the least. Kind and compassionate by nature, these creatures had no ill intentions towards the pyreans, yet they soon became unwelcome in their land because of their imposing and menacing appearance. The settlers were quick to judge them as beasts and soon began to provoke and attack them, a reaction that served to the odyrs as a sign that they were to return to the Cloven Plateaus and forever remain there, far from any settlement.
'Odyrs were giant and extremely robust, with a thick bristly mantle which preserved their body temperature. These attributes granted them the ability to endure the extreme weather common to the latitudes they inhabited,' the mentor continued. 'Despite their primitive tendencies, they were cunning and intelligent, and they had often hunted pyreans as a food source before they were cast back into the canyons.'
Interjections of wonder were heard amongst the apprentices. Many covered their mouths; others were struck with surprise and did not react.
'How could they eat pyreans?!' Jack felt the urge to ask without permission, and his tone was smeared with nausea.
Mentor Gordon gave him a sharp glance, and continued, 'Odyrs might have very well been our ancestors, as difficult as it may be to acknowledge. It is believed that they were once antigans but were exposed to the Torment for far too long during the Age of Obscurity. It slowly deformed their appearance and twisted their minds as they turned to savagery. They began to feed on whatever they could find, and when food became scarce, they began to feed on each other,' he said and sighed affectedly. 'It is regrettable, but such was the outcome for most of those who existed in the time before our Guiding Father.'
As the apprentices fell into quiet contemplation, the mentor conveyed to the holoprojector a depiction of their appearance. Most reacted with silent discomfort, shifting in their seats or looking away, and for a moment not even the sound of breathing was heard inside the room. You even thought that Marlene would throw up again as you glanced at her and saw her already pale cheeks become more and more anemic. But she controlled her displeasure, as did the rest of the class. You were one step away from becoming citizens, and apprenticeship had a way of disconnecting a darmian's mind from the world outside. A cold detachment for all things beyond the Great Wall and the Sea of Tranquility had been bred into your hearts and minds, and some were even beginning to see things with the insensible analytical perspective of a Mentalist. Yet, as you looked at their depiction, you could not help but feel awe. They were shaped in the same fashion as pyreans, but their constitution was most different: their long arms ended in huge paws clad with long claws and they were almost twice as big as an average darmian, and their body was entirely covered with a thick mane of gray and white fur. Their face was covered in fur as well, with two menacingly sharp lower teeth sprouting from their dark lips, dark as their round smooth nose, eyelids and ears. Yet for all its ferocious appearance there was something deep in its hazel eyes, a profound kindness, a soft exuding compassion that revealed their bonds of kinship with the Pyre. Tears of wonder lit your eyes as you felt that you were looking at a long-lost ancestor, now found.
'That is one ugly creature!' Jack cried, as was his habit when things impressed him beyond restrain.
This time it was the mentor who allowed himself to giggle in response. 'They are, are they not?' he said in a joyous mood, entirely out of conduct for a mentor. 'Sometimes I wonder in my worst of thoughts, how foul they must smell or sound. It is very relieving to know that we will never have to see one in person.'
You were deeply disturbed by his derision. You dismissed Jack's answer altogether for you knew he did not mean those words, not truly. But the disdain in the mentor's eyes, the snide sound of his voice, forced you to speak, 'Mentor Gordon, I do not think your behavior is acceptable for a citizen of Darm,' you said, and your harsh remark pierced the air with the dominance of a reprimand.
A thick terrible silence smothered the indoctrination room. No image more frightening could have caused more dread in the eyes of mentor Gordon than the words you spoke. His stare was of shock. But yours was filled with resolve as you waited for him to answer to the letter. In fact, you wanted him to. Some unknown feeling stirred inside you when mentor Gordon spoke ill of the odyrs, and it seeped into your thoughts, begging you to allow it to take over. 
...the things that are foulest are buried deep within us...they have neither sound...nor smell...nor shape...
Mentor Gordon's face turned into a blank pale expression. His lips trembled slightly and for a moment he seemed to shrink to the image of a frightened pyrean. 
Suddenly, he skimmed his hands down his jacket, hid them behind his back and stretched himself tall upon the dais. 
'So, it seems you are productive after all, apprentice Balthazar. One can only be grateful to have an apprentice such as you to ensure the validity of one's indoctrination,' he said with a clear sharp voice. 'You are correct, for once. My apologies, class.'
Then he looked at Jack and with solemn formality declared:
'Apprentice Thompson, it is the second occasion during this indoctrination alone that you have disregarded the obligation to request permission to speak. As your colleague so vehemently reminded me, I am forced to notify you, for the first and last time, that if you are to disregard any obligation but once more, you will be disciplined accordingly, as it is commanded by the Directives established by the Council of Mentalists.'
Jack was speechless. He looked at him submissively and nodded. 'I understand, mentor Gordon,' he said despondently.
After the reprimand, the lesson proceeded with an eerie quietness. From time to time the mentor would look out the windowed wall to stare at one or another detachment of sentinels that patrolled the curved walkway between the Academy and the Central Circle, utterly unaware of the prolonged amount of time he spent in doing so, and the indoctrination soon ended, sooner than anyone would expect, but not sooner enough than everyone would like. As your colleagues stood and walked to the exit, you waited for Jack while he silently rolled up his neuropad, his head tilting low, his joyous mood turned into aloofness.
'My apologies, Jack,' you said as he walked towards the exit.
He stopped and looked at you dejectedly.
'Apology not accepted,' he said chipping your shoulder as he exited.
Mentor Gordon calmly followed behind and when he walked past you, he threw you a thin smile.
...cunning beast...

As you sat quietly next to Haji, while you finished your lunch in the great table of the crowded mess hall, Cathy, who had already finished hers, approached you intently, 'Do not worry, Alan. Jack will forget all about it after tonight's Gathering.'
'It was not your fault, Alan,' added Sophie, standing next to her. 'You did well in alerting mentor Gordon of his behavior. I for one found his disregard towards formality very upsetting.'
'Thank you,' you said to them, and a chain of thoughts led you to a curious conclusion. 'On a related topic Jack was the fourth person I had to apologize to today, - you gave Haji a sidelong glance and spoke close to his ear - I'm blazing, as gastians say.'
Haji smiled.
'How do you know what gastians say?' Sophie asked, leering at you with suspicion.
You looked at her with surprise and quickly corrected yourself, 'Would say! I mean as gastians would say, that is if I ever met one in person.'
'And how do you know what they would say?' she insisted.
There was no way of quelling her suspicion without lying, but you could not lie without your Unit notifying Mother of such act, which would result in being summoned by Overseers for interrogation. However, revealing the truth to her and Cathy was as dangerous a compromise as was lying. As you gave them a baffled stare, a subtle solution quickly came to your mind, 'I'm guessing?' you asked rhetorically.
Sophie squinted at you. 'Well, I guess you're not as smart as you think you are if you think you can trick me into thinking that that is what you thought.'
You blinked at her innocently, 'What?!'
'I am watching you, Alan,' she said. 'And if you lead Haji into breaching the Directives with more of your mischief you will have to answer to me. That is what!'
She then turned her back and headed out of the mess hall with Cathy at her side.
'Why am I making everyone upset today?' you asked Haji with a surprised look.
'If I were to speculate, I would say it is due to your disinclination towards obeying the Directives, your continuous acts of defiance towards most mentors, and your propensity for finding trouble where trouble is most unlikely to be, troublemaker.'
'Not you too!' you complained under a sigh.
Haji gave you a sly smile. 'I assumed my thorough analysis would cheer you up,' he said and got up with his empty tray on his hands.
'It most certainly did not!' you said and followed him with your tray on your hands.

Every last day of the week before Rest Day the indoctrinations at the Academy ended after lunch, for the Council considered it was best to grant the apprentices some spare time to allow them to review what had been taught during the week. On that special day, the one thousand finalists were granted the afternoon to begin the Gathering, and as soon as Cathy left the Academy, they followed her towards her suite. You, however, had to complete the tasks Miriam had appointed earlier, before even thinking of entertainment.
'Do not take too long, or you will miss all of the individual presentations,' Sophie said, as you and Haji departed in different directions from the mass of apprentices.
'We will not,' Haji assured.
Aware of how daunting the task appointed to you was, Haji had offered to help you, in order to spare you from arriving late at the Gathering. As you slowly rode your hoverboard towards your residence with him at your side, you removed the strange bracelet from your utility belt and showed it to him. After briefly speculating as to whom the bracelet belonged to, you arrived at your residence and stashed it in a small box you kept in your desk drawer, which you used to hide personal items. It was a fortunate gesture. Had you not hidden it there and you would have never found its owner.
Tenth memory - The Gathering

''Love is that which gives us so many reasons to smile and at the same time too many reasons to cry.''

A passage from a recovered manuscript of the Antiga Pyre: Unknown Author;


Cathy's skyscraper was one of the nearest to the western shore of the Specialist Class Sector. After tidying up your residence, you and Haji headed off in that direction. Haji had suggested taking the Panoramic Highway, concerned that the snowstorm that had been forecasted would hit Darm sooner than anticipated, but what you had to say was best not to be heard by prying ears. So instead, after crossing the South Boulevard, you and Haji made your way down one of the long avenues, surrounded by imposing skyscrapers. Along the avenue, there were ventilation boxes that continuously spewed a warm flow of air into the streets, and hovering lamps that cast small circles of light on the white pavement. Mithras had begun setting on the horizon, slowly relinquishing the heavens to an ominous blanket of grey clouds that approached from the sea.
'It has to belong to the missing Specialists,' you said to Haji through your facemask's speaker.
'It could belong to anyone, Alan,' Haji answered. 'However, given that it is an unusual object, I would speculate that it could very well come from the Project Facility. By the look of it, it seems to be some sort of identification tag.'
'Then there's the symbol of infinity on the clasp,' you said, adding evidence to his reasoning. 'It must have a meaning of some sort.'
Haji replied with some disquiet, 'If the bracelet does belong to the missing Specialists, it is best that you deliver it to the D.S.D.. You were very fortunate that the sentinels did not find it when they scanned you, or you would be in trouble.'
Instead of feeling concerned, you mocked, 'Maybe they were so impressed by my hoverboard that they ended up overlooking it,' you said.
'That is unlikely,' Haji answered, unchanged by your attempt of humoring him. 'The most reasonable explanation is that they categorized it as a personal item.'
'Well, I am not returning it,' you retorted firmly.
'It was merely a prudent suggestion,' Haji replied and smiled, 'I did not think you would.'
Nearing Cathy's skyscraper, you shared a moment of silence.
'Did you know that the antigans had a different designation for the symbol of infinity?' he said out of impulse, for his mind had been giving continuity to the conversation.
'No, I didn't,' you answered inattentively, while you made plans to find out more about the bracelet after the Gathering.
'Well, they did. They named it lemniscate. I found the definition and its origin on an off-topic thread. It was not even in the Fundaments of Modelation segment.'
'How did you come across it?' you asked.
'By chance, when I was preparing a Fundaments of Modelation indoctrination,' Haji said innocently.
A few minutes later, you arrived at the skyscraper's anteroom, just as gentle snowflakes began leisurely descending from the gray sky. After crossing the curved permaglass door, elegantly decorated with imprinted depictions of Specialists in various activities, you removed your facemasks and took off your gloves. For a moment, you felt trapped inside the soundproof anteroom, between the falling snow and the impassable plasma barrier that blocked the access to the entry hall. You approached the touchscreen imbued next to the plasma barrier and waved your forearm near it. ''Access Granted'' flashed in green on the touchscreen and you crossed the harmless barrier for it had adjusted its frequency to match your body's frequency, allowing you and only you to traverse it.
Haji repeated the process, and soon both of you were inside a comfortably acclimatized round hall, tall and wide, and all but empty except for four columns separated at equal lengths from the center. The walls were made of pure gold , which reflected the bright light coming from a portentous crystal chandelier hanging from the golden ceiling. As was custom in all skyscrapers, you placed your boots, your gloves and your facemasks on the two small compartments that opened on the wall to the left and took two pairs of fluffy slippers from inside them.
'Comfy,' you said as you put on the slippers and felt them around your feet.
Haji smiled at you. 'They are. Even if the insulating properties of our exoderm are enough to keep us warm, they add an extra comfort to walking.'
'One more reason to become a Specialist,' you teased.
The compartments closed as you hovered your Units over its touchscreens. 
A few fluffy footsteps later, you were at the end of the lobby, facing the magtubes that would hurtle you to Cathy's suite.
'You go first,' you said with a look of aversion, as you stared inside the floorless tube.
Haji smirked at you, 'Still afraid of falling?' he teased.
'I am not afraid of falling!' you promptly grunted. 'I just don't like stepping into...nothingness.'
'You do know that the probability of falling is close to zero,' Haji explained before he himself stepped inside the tube. 'Even if there was a sudden power shortage the safety nets installed below every level would catch you.'
He had barely placed his two feet inside when he fell into the dark, wiggling his raised arms and yelling helplessly.
Blood drained from your cheeks and your eyes widened in panic. You were just about to jump in to try and rescue him when he slowly floated up, smiling at your terrified face, and then flew upwards.
'Ohhh...I will get you...' you said through clenched teeth before finally stepping in.

When you reached the right level, you jumped out of the magtube and found yourself next to Haji in a long narrow lobby veiled in darkness. Its dim lighting came from hidden lamps in the sides of the floor, whose soft beams climbed the golden walls and lit the ceiling. As you peered inside, you noticed the slender shape of two pyreas in strange clothing, chattering at the other end of the hall. You quickly concluded that they were finalists coated in animal attire.
One of them approached you. 
'You're here!' she said in a joyous voice.
You immediately recognized the voice, but Haji spoke first. 'Salutations, Cathy,' he said and bowed. 'I would never have recognized you with that animal attire.'
Cathy gave him a wide smile and slowly spun around herself. Her body was coated in short white fur, firmly adhered to her slender curves in such fashion that enhanced her sensuality. She had furry white tufts on her hands and feet and one on her lower back, and a pair of tall, folded ears springing from her curly red hair. Her gorgeous face was covered in white make-up, her lips glossy red, her nose black, and pairs of long whiskers sprang from her cheeks.
As you admired her from head to feet, you wanted to say how impressive she looked, but somehow, you had been rendered mute. She looked unusual yet striking, intensely compelling, irresistibly compelling. Without apparent reason, you felt an intense itching in your whole body, and you could not resist scratching yourself.
'Alan?' she asked, surprised by your odd gestures.
Haji elbowed you. 'Stop that,' he spoke with a sidelong glance.
'I can't. Sometimes I get a strong itchy feeling when I get out of a magtube,' you explained.
'It is a rare side-effect caused by the magnetic field that traverses through the Nervous System,' he said, looking at you sternly. 'It happens when the nervous system suffers a critical breakdown. You probably will turn into a puddle of organic matter soon.'
When your Unit did not signal that he was lying, you widened your eyes in terror.
'Of course, the probability of that happening is even lower than suffering injury by falling down a magtube,' he added with a sly smile.
You glared at him. 'I am so going to get you.'
Haji chuckled and then looked at Cathy. 'Are you not going to introduce us to your friend?' he said.
Cathy's friend had been silently watching the conversation, amusement filling her furry face.
'You don't recognize her?' Cathy asked.
Her attire looked even more exotic. Her body was coated in short amber fur sprinkled with round black dots; at the end of her smooth curvy back a long tail extended down her slender legs. Jutting from her auburn hair were two small round ears and the make-up on her face drew two dark strips that fell from her eyes down to her soft chin, granting her an appearance both stunning and wild. She drew out a long white smile that contrasted with her black nose and her amber glossed lips.
'I told you he would not recognize me,' she said with a soft subtle voice.
Haji gave her a stunned gaze. 'Sophie?'
Sophie giggled and nodded her feline head. Her green eyes shone at him with glamour.
For the first time, Haji was completely speechless. An undeniable realization awoke in him at that moment, and he knew beyond doubt that she was the girl he was going spend the rest of his existence with. 'I am at a loss for words to describe how remarkable you look, Sophie,' he said with some effort.
Sophie's bright brown eyes overflowed with happiness. 'If it were not for the make-up, you would see that I was blushing,' she said.
You felt the need to make amends for your stagnant staring and intervened with a somewhat similar comment. 'You don't look that bad either, Cathy,' you told her in a confident manner.
Cathy's joyous smile turned into an incredulous stare.
'Is that all you can say, Alan?' Sophie asked with amicable derision.
You shrunk under Cathy's increasing glower and began stuttering incomprehensibly, all the while thinking that it had been best if you had kept on smiling and scratching yourself, quietly.
'Do not feel disappointed Cathy,' said Haji. 'When Alan is impressed by something, he sometimes has bursts of inappropriate comments.'
'He's bursting, alright,' she said, her arms crossed and sneering at you. 'With silliness.'
You stopped scratching yourself. 'I am so, so, so gonna get you,' you whispered close to Haji ear. Then you looked at Cathy and spoke courteously, 'My apologies, Cathy. I meant to say you look as remarkable as Sophie, if not more.'
Cathy forced a smile. 'That sounds better,' then she pointed to a sliding door to the right. 'Now that Sophie and I have been properly complimented, head to the printing device and put on your animal attires. Other people are arriving.'
She had just finished speaking when the magtube announced the arrival of two more guests with a soft tune.
After bowing you both followed through the door, entering a wide and well lit room, the suite's coatroom, and found the device at the center standing on a round base with two steps. It was a tall transparent cylinder, much like an incubation tank. The touchpanel was above a small station next to the door and was waiting for input.
'An actual printing device,' you said as you slid your hand across the device's transparent door. 'I wonder how many credits it cost.'
'Being under the care of Specialists has its advantages,' Haji stated without any ill intention.
You and Haji removed your uniforms, leaving nothing but the dark-gray exoderm on your skin, and placed them on an opened wardrobe imbued in the wall, with green jackets and pants hanging on hooks. Once the hooks felt your uniforms, they receded inside the wardrobe before it closed, leaving a flat wall in its place.
'You can go first,' Haji said.
'No, no. You first,' you answered as you rushed ahead and took the place in front of the station.
Haji smiled and hopped in, closing the door behind. 
Looking at the touchscreen, you dragged your fingers through the attire menu and when you found Haji's Linx pardinus you nodded at him. The thought of getting even with him by tampering with the printing device crossed your mind, but after carefully checking the device's status you started the coating process without changing its specifications, thinking no amount of retribution would justify ruining your best friend's Gathering. 
Haji closed his eyes and stood still, as the chamber was filled with water vapor; then, a metallic ring filled with countless miniscule nozzles descended from its ceiling which began to spray his body with layers and layers of a silicon-based gel in an up and down cycle. You watched his transformation, as he was slowly coated in layers that thickened with each passing of the ring. His face was equally changing, becoming masked by layers of silicon apart from his eyes and lips, which had been previously covered by a protective film.
When the process was complete, the ring bathed him in a hardening layer that solidified the silicone gel to the point of becoming rugged and furry, before a spray of multi-colored ink tinged him until he became like a furry brown animal splattered with black patches. It took a little more than five minutes before the last step started. The ring withdrew into the ceiling and a gust of air coming from fans in the floor blew away any residual substances and dried the ink in place. A sharp ding! announced that the process was complete, and the door was opened. 
When Haji stepped out of the chamber, he looked similar in every way to the Lynx pardinus image displayed on the touchscreen, apart from his graceless walk. Had you not seen the process happen before your eyes and you would have never recognized your best friend if he were to walk up to you unannounced.
'You look just like it!' you said.
