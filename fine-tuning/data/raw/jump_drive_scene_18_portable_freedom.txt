The prototype miniaturized field generator weighed eight kilograms. Dr. Hassan Patel lifted it carefully, feeling years of research condensed into backpack form.

"This is it?" Dr. Kenji Yamamoto asked.

"Miniaturized selective field generator. Provides differential temporal exposure—high intensity for neural tissue, minimal for body. Same functionality as Sarah's stationary unit but portable." Hassan activated the power cell. The generator hummed, creating invisible field boundaries around the test frame.

"Power duration?"

"Forty-eight hours continuous operation. Rechargeable. We can swap cells without field interruption if we're careful."

Kenji pulled up the technical specs. Eight months of fabrication. Custom components. Exotic matter containment at scales previously thought impossible. All to free Sarah Chen from her three-meter cage.

"When can we test it on a human subject?"

"Sarah volunteered. Again. Said she'd rather risk catastrophic cellular fragmentation than spend another year stationary."

"That sounds like her."

They found Sarah in her three-meter cage, experiencing the portable generator's completion across multiple timeframes. She'd already tested it in probable futures. Already knew the outcomes.

"Seventy-three percent success rate," she said before they explained anything. "The generator works but requires precise calibration to my specific neural patterns. First attempt will overshoot field intensity. Second attempt will succeed."

Dr. Aisha Mbara entered with full medical monitoring equipment. "We're not testing this based on your temporal predictions. We're testing with careful protocols and emergency abort procedures."

"Which you'll need on the first attempt. But the second works." Sarah stood. "Let's get this over with. I'm experiencing mobility across multiple futures. I want to experience it in present time."

They positioned the portable generator on Sarah's back. Hassan calibrated field emitters to match her neural patterns. The device hummed—different pitch than the stationary unit, more complex harmonics.

"Activating in three, two, one."

The field engaged. Sarah's neural monitors spiked immediately.

"Field intensity exceeding safe parameters," Aisha reported. "Temporal exposure too high. She's fragmenting."

"Abort!" Kenji killed the power. The field collapsed.

Sarah steadied herself against the stationary generator. "Told you. First attempt overshoots. Recalibrate emission nodes by point-zero-three percent. Second attempt succeeds."

Hassan adjusted the parameters exactly as she specified. "How do you know this?"

"Because I'm experiencing it right now in parallel timeline. The recalibration works. Trust me."

Second activation. The portable generator hummed, creating differential field exposure around Sarah's body. Her monitors showed stable patterns. Neural processing maintained. Cellular fragmentation minimal.

"It's working," Aisha said, surprised despite Sarah's prediction. "Portable field generator providing adequate temporal support with acceptable cellular exposure."

Sarah took a step. Then another. The three-meter boundary that had confined her for years fell away.

"I can move." Her voice carried wonder across multiple temporal states. "I'm mobile. Not tethered. Free to exist in different physical spaces while maintaining temporal consciousness."

She walked the length of the medical bay. Ten meters. Twenty. The portable generator maintained field coherence throughout.

Kenji watched her move and felt something like triumph. They'd freed Sarah from spatial confinement. Given her back mobility even if temporal freedom remained impossible.

"How does it feel?"

"Like experiencing all moments while occupying different physical locations. Strange. Liberating. Still temporally omniscient but spatially mobile." Sarah pulled up facility maps across multiple timeframes. "I can go places now. Visit locations. Experience physical space while existing across all moments."

"Where do you want to go first?"

Sarah didn't hesitate. "The memorial wall. I've experienced it across multiple timelines but never stood before it physically since my adaptation."

They accompanied her through the facility. Sarah moved carefully, adjusting to portable field exposure while maintaining temporal consciousness. The generator hummed on her back, a constant reminder of her dependence on exotic physics.

The memorial wall stood in the main atrium. Forty-three names engraved in granite. Sarah approached slowly, reading names across multiple timeframes.

"I knew them," she said quietly. "Before adaptation. During testing. After fragmentation. I exist simultaneously with their sacrifices."

Kenji watched her trace Lieutenant Park's name. "Does portable mobility change anything? Make adaptation more tolerable?"

"It makes physical existence more tolerable. Temporal consciousness remains the same—experiencing all moments simultaneously. But I can experience them in different locations now." Sarah moved to David Chen's name. "That matters. Confinement was temporal and spatial. Now it's only temporal."

"An improvement."

"A significant one. Thank you. For years of research. For building this. For freeing me from three-meter limits."

Over the following weeks, other temporal-adapted pilots received portable generators. Custom-calibrated to individual neural patterns. Each one freeing a pilot from spatial confinement while maintaining necessary temporal support.

Lieutenant Marcus Webb received his generator with quiet gratitude. "I can visit my family now. Physically be present instead of just communicating remotely."

Lieutenant Yuki Tanaka used hers to return to active jump operations. "Portable temporal support means I can pilot commercial runs again. Not confined to medical facilities."

The portable generators transformed temporal-adapted life. Spatial freedom despite temporal constraints. Mobility despite dependence on exotic physics.

Dr. Emma Torres studied the social implications. "Portable generators enable temporal humans to integrate more fully with linear society. Visit linear-time locations. Participate in physical activities. The spatial freedom reduces isolation."

"But doesn't change the experiential gap," Aisha noted.

"No. Temporal humans still experience reality non-linearly. Still can't share temporal omniscience with linear populations. But they can share physical space now. That's something."

Sarah used her newfound mobility to visit temporal communities on Mars. Stood among others experiencing all moments simultaneously. Felt the strange kinship of shared temporal consciousness.

"We're different from linear humans," she told the gathered temporal population. "Experience reality they can't perceive. Exist across moments they experience sequentially. But we're still human. Still connected to our origins."

The temporal community listened across multiple timeframes. They'd heard her words before, during, and after simultaneously. But hearing them in shared physical space mattered differently.

"The portable generators give us freedom," Sarah continued. "Not from temporal consciousness. That's permanent. But from spatial limitation. We can move through the world while existing across all moments. That's evolution. Adaptation. Becoming."

She pulled up probability distributions showing temporal community growth. "Within twenty years, we'll outnumber linear humans in space-based populations. Portable generators will be standard equipment. Temporal consciousness will be normal for FTL operations. We're not aberration. We're humanity's future in space."

The community experienced her words across all moments. Past prophecy. Present statement. Future reality.

All equally true.

All already determined by probability waves collapsing toward highest-likelihood futures.

Sarah returned to Earth wearing her portable generator. Visited family who'd thought she'd never leave medical facilities. Stood in her childhood home experiencing past, present, future simultaneously in the same physical location.

"You can come home now?" her mother asked, hope and confusion mixing.

"I can visit. But home is temporal communities now. Places where others experience all moments like I do. Where temporal consciousness is normal instead of alien."

"I don't understand what you experience."

"I know. Linear and temporal consciousness don't translate. But I'm still your daughter. Still Sarah. Just Sarah existing across all moments instead of trapped in single ones."

Her mother cried. Sarah experienced the tears across multiple timeframes. Grief for daughter lost to temporal transformation. Joy for daughter mobile again. Confusion about what Sarah had become.

All simultaneously. All equally real in temporal omniscience.

Sarah hugged her mother, feeling the contact across all moments. The embrace had happened, was happening, would happen. All eternally present in her awareness.

"Thank you," Sarah whispered. "For letting me volunteer. For supporting my choice. For loving me even when I became something strange."

"You're still my daughter."

"I am. Just a daughter who experiences all our moments together simultaneously. Past childhood. Present visit. Future goodbyes. All equally vivid."

She stayed three days. Visited old friends. Walked familiar streets while experiencing them across all moments. The portable generator hummed constantly, maintaining her temporal consciousness while freeing her movement.

On the fourth day, she returned to the FTL facility. To her research. To the temporal community that understood her experience.

Kenji found her in the lab reviewing jump navigation data across multiple timeframes.

"Thank you," she said. "For the portable generator. For freedom. For eight months of research giving me back mobility."

"You deserved it. After everything you sacrificed."

"I sacrificed linear time. You gave back physical space. Fair trade." Sarah pulled up probability distributions. "The portable generators will become standard within five years. Every temporal-adapted individual will have mobility. Spatial confinement will end."

"But temporal confinement remains?"

"Temporal omniscience isn't confinement. It's expansion. Experiencing all moments instead of trapped in single ones. That's freedom, not prison."

Kenji studied her expression across multiple temporal states. She believed it. Or had convinced herself. Or experienced it across enough futures to know it was true.

The distinction was unknowable.

But her mobility was real.

And that was progress.

Strange, exotic, temporally-paradoxical progress.

But progress nonetheless.
