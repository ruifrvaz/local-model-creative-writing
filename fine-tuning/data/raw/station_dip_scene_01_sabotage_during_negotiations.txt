Ambassador Chen Wu watched the delegates enter the neutral conference chamber with the wariness of prey animals approaching a waterhole.

Earth Coalition on the left. Six representatives in formal gray suits. Corporate backing. Military support.

Independent Colonies on the right. Four representatives in practical coveralls. Resource-poor. Ideologically committed.

And Chen in the middle, representing Station Kepler. Neutral ground. Safe harbor. The only place both sides would meet.

"Thank you for attending," Chen began. "The station appreciates—"

"Let's skip the pleasantries," Coalition delegate Marcus Steele interrupted. "We're here to discuss colonial independence claims. Specifically, why the Independents think they can claim mining rights to entire asteroid fields."

"Because we found them first," Independent delegate Sarah Okonkwo replied. "Before your corporations even knew the fields existed."

"Discovery doesn't equal ownership under interstellar law."

"Your law. Written by Earth governments to benefit Earth corporations."

Chen raised a hand. "We're not here to resolve two centuries of colonial policy. We're here to prevent the current crisis from escalating into violence."

"The crisis was created by Coalition aggression," Okonkwo said. "Three of our mining ships have been seized in the last month."

"Those ships were operating in contested zones," Steele countered. "We offered compensation for proper licensing."

"You offered exploitation contracts. Twenty-year terms at fixed prices below market value."

The argument continued. Chen had mediated seventeen sessions in the last three months. Each one followed the same pattern. Accusations. Counteraccusations. No progress.

But he kept trying. Because the alternative was war.

Security Officer Lena Volkov watched from the observation room above. She didn't trust either delegation. Didn't trust the weapons scans that supposedly cleared them. Didn't trust the peace process.

Someone wanted this negotiation to fail. She could feel it in her bones.

Her comm chimed. One of her officers, Rodriguez. "Chief, we have an anomaly in the ventilation system. Section 12, near the conference chamber."

"What kind of anomaly?"

"Pressure fluctuation. Minor. But recurring. Started thirty minutes ago."

Lena pulled up the system diagnostics. Rodriguez was right. Small pressure variations. Rhythmic. Like something was being injected into the airflow.

"Seal Section 12. Now. Reroute air supply."

"Copy that."

Lena headed for the chamber. Moving fast but not panicking. Years of security work had taught her the value of controlled response.

She reached the conference level as the ventilation sealed. The delegates were still arguing. Chen was still mediating.

Everything looked normal.

Except the pressure readings that didn't make sense.

Lena entered the chamber. "Ambassador Chen, we need to evacuate. Possible environmental contamination."

Steele stood immediately. "What kind of contamination?"

"Unknown. Precautionary measure." Lena gestured to the exits. "Please move to the secure holding area."

The delegates filed out. Slowly. Reluctantly. Politicians never liked being told what to do.

Chen remained behind. "What did you find?"

"Maybe nothing. Maybe something. I'll know more after we scan the chamber."

Her team arrived with detection equipment. Chemical sensors. Biological samplers. Radiation detectors.

The results came back in five minutes.

Negative on chemical weapons. Negative on biological agents. Negative on radiation.

But the air composition was wrong. Elevated carbon dioxide. Decreased oxygen. Not enough to be dangerous yet. But trending toward hypoxia.

"Someone's trying to make them drowsy," Chen said. "Impair judgment. Make them sign agreements they wouldn't normally accept."

"Or create medical emergencies that end the negotiations." Lena pulled up the ventilation schematics. "The injection point is external. Someone accessed the duct work from outside the secure zone."

"Find them."

Lena dispatched teams. The station was large—three kilometers in diameter. Thousands of rooms. Hundreds of ventilation access points.

But she had advantages. Security cameras. Automated tracking. Biometric sensors.

She pulled up movement logs. Looking for anomalies. People where they shouldn't be. Access to restricted areas.

There. A maintenance worker. Credentials checked out. But the timing was wrong. They'd entered the ventilation shaft ten minutes before the pressure anomalies started.

Lena pulled up the worker's ID. The photo didn't match any registered station personnel.

Fake credentials. Sophisticated ones. But fake.

"All units, we have a saboteur. Maintenance worker in ventilation Section 12. Approach with caution."

Her team converged on the location. Lena arrived first, weapon drawn.

The ventilation shaft was empty. The saboteur had run.

But they'd left evidence. A small device attached to the airflow regulator. Still pumping carbon dioxide into the system.

Lena disabled it and bagged it for analysis. Then she accessed the ventilation network's internal cameras.

The saboteur was three sections away. Moving fast. Heading for the docking ring.

"They're trying to escape. Lock down all airlocks."

Station Director Kwame Nkrumah's voice came over her comm. "Lockdown authorized. But Volkov, we have Coalition and Independent ships docked. If this saboteur reaches either one—"

"I know. Diplomatic incident. Possible war." Lena ran for the docking ring. "I won't let them reach the ships."

The chase wound through maintenance corridors. Industrial sections where few people went. The saboteur was trained. Military-grade movements. Professional evasion tactics.

But Lena was better.

She cut them off at Junction 7. The saboteur turned, raising a weapon.

Lena fired first. Stun round. The saboteur dropped.

She secured the suspect and called for backup. "Target detained. Need medical and interrogation teams."

The saboteur was human. Mid-thirties. No identifying marks. No obvious affiliation.

But when Lena searched them, she found something interesting. A data chip. Encrypted. Hidden in a false tooth.

"Director Nkrumah, I need Ambassador Chen. And our best decryption specialist."

They reconvened in the security center. The saboteur was in medical, unconscious. The data chip was being analyzed.

Chen arrived with both delegations. "What did you find?"

"A professional operative. Equipped with fake credentials and sophisticated infiltration gear." Lena pulled up the analysis. "The device they planted would have induced hypoxia gradually. Delegates would have become confused. Prone to mistakes."

"Favoring which side?" Steele demanded.

"Neither. Or both. The effect would have been unpredictable." Lena highlighted the data chip. "But this is interesting. It contains payment records."

The decryption finished. Financial transactions appeared on the screen.

Payments from a third party. Not Coalition. Not Independents.

A corporation neither side had mentioned. Helios Mining Consortium. Based in the outer belt. Profiting from conflict between major powers.

"They wanted negotiations to fail," Chen said quietly. "Wanted continued tension so they could operate in the shadows."

Steele and Okonkwo looked at each other. For the first time in three months, they shared an expression. Mutual outrage.

"Someone's playing us," Steele said.

"Profiting from our conflict." Okonkwo's voice was hard. "While we fight each other, third parties steal resources."

Chen saw his opportunity. "Perhaps this crisis reveals a common interest. Both Coalition and Independents lose when outside actors manipulate events."

The delegates were quiet. Calculating. Reassessing.

"We should resume negotiations," Steele said finally. "But with expanded scope. Including protocols for identifying and preventing third-party interference."

"Agreed," Okonkwo said. "And information sharing. If Helios is playing both sides, we need to coordinate response."

Chen allowed himself a small smile. Crisis averted. War prevented. At least for now.

"I'll prepare the conference chamber. Station security will ensure no further incidents."

The delegates returned to negotiations. This time with shared purpose. This time with common enemy.

Lena watched from the observation room. The saboteur had failed. But there would be others. There always were.

Her job was stopping them. Protecting the fragile peace. Maintaining the neutral ground where humanity's factions could talk instead of fight.

One crisis at a time. One threat prevented.

It wasn't glory. But it was necessary.

And on a neutral station between warring powers, necessary was the highest calling.

She returned to her security monitors. Watching. Waiting.

Ready for the next threat. The next crisis. The next attempt to destroy what diplomacy built.

Because peace was always fragile. Always threatened.

And someone had to stand guard.
