Dr. Omar Hassan stood in the drill chamber, staring at readings that made no sense.

The seismic survey showed a void. Two kilometers down, directly beneath the habitat's foundation. A cavity forty meters across, where solid bedrock should be.

He ran the scan again. Same result.

"Commander Rivera needs to see this," he said to his assistant, Park.

Park was young, fresh from Earth, still enthusiastic about Martian geology. "Could be a lava tube. They're common in volcanic regions."

"We're not in a volcanic region. The geological surveys from orbit showed stable ancient crust." Omar pulled up the original landing site analysis. "This area was chosen specifically because it's geologically dead."

"Then what created the void?"

That was the question that kept Omar awake at night. He'd found three more voids in the last month. All roughly the same size. All clustered within a five-kilometer radius of the habitat.

All newly formed.

The seismic data showed no quakes. No tremors. No volcanic activity. The voids simply appeared, as if something was hollowing out Mars from below.

Omar saved the data and headed for the command module. Rivera would want answers. The problem was, Omar didn't have any.

The command module occupied the central hub of the habitat. Screens covered three walls, displaying life support status, power consumption, communications schedules. Commander Rivera sat at her desk, reviewing supply manifests.

She looked up when Omar entered. "Dr. Hassan. You look concerned."

"Found another void. Directly beneath Module A."

Rivera's expression hardened. "Show me."

Omar transferred the seismic data to her screen. She studied it in silence, her fingers drumming an unconscious rhythm on her desk.

"How stable is our foundation?" she asked.

"Currently? Solid. The voids are deep enough that there's no immediate collapse risk." Omar pulled up the structural analysis. "But if they continue forming closer to the surface, or if they grow larger..."

"We'd have to evacuate."

"Yes."

Rivera stood and walked to the window. Outside, the Martian landscape stretched red and barren under a salmon sky. The horizon was perfectly flat—ancient plains, geologically stable for billions of years.

Except they weren't stable. Not anymore.

"Does Earth know?" she asked.

"Not yet. I wanted to brief you first."

"Good. Keep it that way." Rivera turned back to him. "If Olympus Resource Corporation hears we're sitting on unstable ground, they'll pull our mining license. Every other corporate interest will fight to claim the territory."

"With respect, Commander, people's safety—"

"Is my priority. Which is why we need to understand what's happening before we trigger a panic." Rivera pulled up a star chart. "The next supply ship arrives in six weeks. If we determine we need to evacuate, that's our window."

"And if the voids accelerate before then?"

"Then we use the emergency shelters and pray the backup plan works." Rivera met his eyes. "How many voids have you found total?"

"Eight confirmed. Possibly more that haven't shown up on our scans yet."

"Pattern?"

"Clustered around our site. Nowhere else in the region." Omar hesitated. "Commander, I think we caused this."

Rivera's expression didn't change. "Explain."

"The borehole drilling for water. We've been extracting subsurface ice for eight months. What if we're destabilizing something? Creating cavities as the ice melts?"

"Your surveys showed the ice deposits were isolated. No structural role."

"We thought they were isolated. But Mars has surprised us before." Omar pulled up the drill logs. "Look at the extraction patterns. Every void location corresponds to a borehole we drilled three to four months ago."

Rivera studied the correlation. "You're saying our water extraction is causing the planet to collapse beneath us."

"I'm saying it's possible. We don't fully understand Martian subsurface geology. Maybe the ice was providing structural support we didn't account for."

"Then we stop drilling."

"We stop drilling, we run out of water in eight weeks. Maybe less if Kwan's recycling problems continue."

They looked at each other, the impossible choice hanging between them.

Water or stability. Survival today or survival tomorrow.

Rivera pulled up the colony's resource projections. "How much water do we have in reserve?"

"Thirty thousand liters. With strict rationing, that's forty days."

"And the supply ship?"

"Forty-two days out."

"So if we stop drilling now, we might make it. Barely."

"Assuming the voids don't collapse before then." Omar highlighted the largest cavity. "This one's growing. Two meters expansion in the last week."

Rivera was quiet for a long moment. Outside, the Martian wind picked up, swirling dust against the habitat windows. The planet was beautiful in its desolation. Deadly in its indifference.

"We continue drilling," she said finally. "But we move operations. Find new sites away from the existing boreholes."

"That could just create more voids elsewhere."

"Or it could prove your theory wrong. Either way, we need data." Rivera pulled up the habitat map. "And we start preparing emergency protocols. Quiet evacuation drills. Structural reinforcement of critical modules. I want contingency plans for everything."

"The crew will notice."

"Let them. I'll handle the questions." Rivera turned back to the window. "Mars isn't going to kill my people. Not if I have anything to say about it."

Omar wanted to believe her. But he'd spent six months studying Martian geology. The planet didn't negotiate. It didn't care about human determination or corporate timelines.

It simply was. Ancient. Patient. Dangerous.

And now, beneath their feet, it was changing in ways nobody understood.

"I'll prepare the drilling relocation plan," Omar said.

"And Omar? Keep those scans running. I want to know the moment anything changes."

He nodded and left, the seismic data weighing on his tablet like a stone.

Forty-three people depending on ground that might not be there tomorrow.

Welcome to Mars. Where every solution created two new problems.

And the only constant was uncertainty.
