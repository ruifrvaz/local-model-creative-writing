Commander Rivera arrived first, her expression already tight with the kind of stress that came from managing too many crises. Omar followed, carrying an equipment case.

"Show me," Rivera said.

Alexis handed her the scanner. The display showed the cavity's rhythmic pulse, clear and undeniable.

Rivera studied it for thirty seconds. "Biological?"

"Unknown. But it's responsive. Watch." Alexis triggered the acoustic pulse again. The cavity's rhythm shifted, accelerating slightly, then returning to baseline.

"It's reacting to our scans," Omar said quietly.

"Or to our presence." Rivera set down the scanner. "What are the risks?"

Alexis pulled up her analysis. "Structural compromise if it expands. Thermal destabilization if it's generating heat. Unknown contamination risk if we breach it. Unknown defensive response if we're perceived as a threat."

"Defensive response." Rivera's voice was flat. "You're saying this could be hostile."

"I'm saying we don't know what this is. Caution is appropriate."

Omar was already deploying additional sensors, planting them in a grid pattern around the cavity's location. "I want seismic monitoring. If this thing moves, I want to know immediately."

They worked in silence, each focused on their instruments. Alexis watched the cavity's pulse on her scanner, looking for patterns. The rhythm was almost regular—fifteen pulses per minute. Slightly faster than a human heartbeat at rest.

"Could be a reactor," Omar said. "Some kind of geothermal process we don't understand."

"Or a life form adapted to subsurface Mars," Rivera countered. "There've been theories about extremophiles in the deep substrate."

"Theories," Alexis said. "Nothing proven. And nothing that would explain geometric walls or thermal regulation."

Her tablet chirped. A message from Yuki: Adapters fabricated. Starting membrane replacement now. ETA ten hours.

Ten hours until the water system was back online. Alexis checked the reserves again. They were cutting it close.

"We need to make a decision," she said. "Do we investigate this now, or do we focus on the immediate crisis?"

Rivera was quiet, calculating. "How certain are you this isn't an immediate threat?"

"Not certain at all."

"But your gut instinct?"

Alexis looked at the scanner data. The pulse was steady, almost calm. Whatever was down there, it wasn't acting aggressively. Yet.

"My gut says it's been there for a while. Probably predates the colony. If it wanted to hurt us, it's had plenty of opportunities."

"That's not exactly reassuring."

"Nothing about Mars is reassuring, Commander."

Rivera smiled grimly. "Fair point. All right. Omar, keep monitoring. I want continuous data streams to my office. Alexis, you're back on water detail. This cavity is secondary priority until we have confirmation it poses an active threat."

"And if it does?"

"Then we evacuate Hab Three and figure out our next move." Rivera headed for the exit, then paused. "And Alexis? This stays between us for now. The crew's stressed enough without adding 'mysterious underground anomaly' to their worry list."

After Rivera left, Omar and Alexis stood alone in the cramped tunnel. The sensors blinked steadily, recording data that might rewrite human understanding of Mars.

"You think it's alive?" Omar asked.

"I think alive is too simple a word for whatever this is." Alexis packed up her scanner. "But yes. Something down there is active. Aware. Maybe even intelligent."

"Then we're not alone."

"We were never alone. We just didn't know it yet."

Alexis climbed back through the access tunnel, her mind spinning. The water crisis demanded her attention. But the cavity—the presence—pulled at her curiosity like gravity.

Mars had given them a mystery and a deadline. Standard operating procedure for the colony.

She reached the recycling bay to find Yuki installing the adapted membrane. The new mounting brackets were crude but functional—typical Mars engineering. Make it work with what you have.

"How's it looking?" Alexis asked.

"Like it might actually hold." Yuki tightened the last bolt. "We'll know in about two hours when I run the pressure tests."

Alexis helped her align the membrane housing. The work was mechanical, familiar. But her thoughts kept drifting to the cavity three meters below their feet. Pulsing. Waiting. Aware.

"You ever wonder what we're doing here?" Yuki asked.

"Every day."

"I mean really. Why did we come to Mars?" Yuki didn't look up from her work. "Earth has problems. Climate refugees, resource wars, ecological collapse. And we're here playing colony on a frozen desert that wants us dead."

"Because sometimes you have to plant a garden in the wasteland."

"That's very poetic. Also very impractical."

Alexis smiled. "Welcome to Mars."

They finished the membrane installation in silence. Yuki initiated the coupling sequence, and the recycler hummed back to life. Status lights shifted from red to amber to green. Water began flowing through the filtration cascade.

"Pressure holding," Yuki reported. "No leaks detected. I'm bringing the system up to forty percent capacity."

Alexis monitored the outputs. Flow rate increasing. Contamination levels dropping. The membrane was working.

For now.

"Full capacity in six hours," Yuki said. "We'll make it."

Alexis checked the water reserves. They'd bottom out at twelve percent. Dangerously low, but survivable. Another crisis averted through improvisation and luck.

Her tablet showed the cavity's continuous monitoring. Still pulsing. Still stable. Still waiting for someone to understand what it was.

"Get some rest," Alexis told Yuki. "I'll monitor the startup sequence."

"You need rest more than I do."

"I'll rest when the system's stable."

Yuki left, and Alexis settled into the monitoring station. Around her, pipes gurgled and pumps hummed. The mechanical heartbeat of the colony, filtering life from waste, turning scarcity into survival.

Three meters below, another heartbeat pulsed. Alien. Unknown. Patient.

Alexis pulled up both data streams—water system and cavity monitoring. Two rhythms, two systems, both essential to understanding Mars.

The colony had come here to establish human presence on another world.

They might have found something that had been present much longer.

The question was whether it welcomed the company or resented the intrusion.

Alexis suspected they'd find out soon enough.

Mars didn't keep secrets forever. Just long enough to make the revelation dangerous.
