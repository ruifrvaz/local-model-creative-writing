Hassan's drill bit hit something solid at thirty meters. The resistance pattern was wrong—too uniform, too deliberate.

He pulled the core sample and stared at it. Gray metallic composite, layered structure, definitely not natural formation.

"Alexis," he said into the comm. "You need to see this."

She arrived twenty minutes later in the geology rover, Yuki riding shotgun. Hassan had the core sample laid out on his portable analysis bench.

"That's not Martian rock," Alexis said immediately.

"No. It's not." Hassan pulled up the spectral analysis. "Iron-nickel alloy with carbon composite reinforcement. Manufactured."

"How old?"

"Preliminary dating suggests two hundred thousand years. Give or take fifty millennia."

The silence stretched. Outside the rover, the Martian wind pushed red dust across the valley floor. Overhead, the pale sky held no answers.

"We need to excavate it," Yuki said finally. "Whatever it is."

"We need to report it," Alexis countered. "This is first contact protocol. We're way out of our depth."

Hassan studied the core sample. Two hundred thousand years. Humans had barely been using stone tools then. Whatever made this had been building with advanced metallurgy while humanity was still learning to control fire.

"Earth Corp will classify it," he said. "Lock it down, send specialists, take control of the site. We'll never know what we found."

"Because it's bigger than us," Alexis said. "Hassan, this is evidence of alien civilization. We can't just—"

"We're already excavating it." He pointed at his drill rig. "The core sample came from thirty meters down. Whatever this is, it's big."

Yuki pulled up the ground-penetrating radar data. "There's a structure. Roughly spherical, diameter approximately twelve meters. Buried under regolith deposits that took millennia to accumulate."

"A ship?" Alexis suggested.

"Or a habitat. Or a monument. Or something we don't have words for yet." Hassan secured the core sample. "I'm going deeper. Map the full extent."

"Rivera will shut this down the moment he finds out."

"Then we don't tell him until we know what we're dealing with." Hassan met Alexis's eyes. "You said Earth Corp wants profitable discoveries. Alien artifacts qualify."

"If they're real."

"They're real. The question is what they mean."

They worked through the night. Hassan drilled additional cores, mapping the buried structure's outline. Yuki analyzed samples while Alexis ran interference with the colony, manufacturing excuses for their absence.

By dawn, they had a picture. Spherical structure, definitely manufactured, partially collapsed but largely intact. Entry point accessible with excavation equipment.

"We need to go inside," Hassan said.

"Absolutely not." Alexis was firm. "We report this, get proper protocols in place, wait for guidance from Earth."

"Earth is twenty minutes away by light-speed. Forty-minute round trip for messages. Days for decisions. Weeks for specialist teams to arrive." Hassan pulled up the structure's imaging. "We're here now. We have the equipment. We can document this properly before Earth Corp turns it into a corporate asset."

"Or we die in a two-hundred-thousand-year-old collapse and the colony loses three key personnel."

"Then we go careful. Document everything. One person inside, two monitoring from the surface."

Yuki raised her hand. "I'll go. Smallest profile, lightest equipment load."

"No," Alexis said. "If anyone's risking structural collapse, it should be—"

"Me," Hassan interrupted. "It's my discovery. My responsibility."

They argued for another hour, but Hassan won. He always did when it came to his work.

The excavation took two days. Carefully removing regolith, exposing the structure's upper surface. The metal was pitted and scarred but intact. No obvious entry points.

Hassan cut through with a plasma torch. The metal resisted, then yielded. The opening revealed darkness beyond—a chamber untouched for geological timescales.

He descended on a cable, Alexis and Yuki monitoring from above. His suit lights cut through the darkness, revealing walls of that same gray composite.

And symbols.

Intricate patterns etched into the walls, mathematical progressions and stellar cartography and something that might have been writing. Hassan's breath caught.

"I'm documenting," he said, his helmet camera recording everything. "The chamber is roughly ten meters in diameter. Wall inscriptions covering approximately sixty percent of the surface. No obvious technology, no power sources, no—"

He stopped. In the center of the chamber, a pedestal. And on the pedestal, an object.

Crystalline structure, faintly luminescent, geometric precision that hurt to look at directly. Beautiful and wrong in ways Hassan couldn't articulate.

"There's an artifact," he said. "Some kind of crystal or data storage medium."

"Don't touch it," Alexis said immediately.

"I'm not stupid." Hassan circled the pedestal, recording from every angle. The crystal seemed to shift as he moved, internal structures rearranging themselves. "It might be reactive to observation."

"Or it's been sitting in a dead chamber for two hundred thousand years and doesn't care." Yuki's voice was tense. "Hassan, environmental readings?"

He checked his instruments. "Atmosphere is near-vacuum. No power signatures. No radiation beyond ambient Martian background. The structure is inert."

"For now."

Hassan completed his documentation and ascended. They sealed the chamber and spent the rest of the day analyzing the footage.

The symbols defied translation. Mathematical concepts that seemed almost familiar but diverged in fundamental ways. Star charts that matched no known astronomical configuration—either the cartography was wrong or the stars had moved significantly since the map was made.

"Two hundred thousand years," Yuki murmured. "The stellar drift alone would make navigation impossible."

"Unless they accounted for it," Hassan said. "Unless they were thinking on timescales we can't comprehend."

Alexis made the call to Rivera that evening. His response was predictable—lockdown the site, report to Earth Corp, wait for instructions.

But the damage was done. They'd seen inside. They'd documented proof that humanity wasn't alone in the universe, wasn't the first intelligence to look at the stars and wonder.

"What do you think they were?" Yuki asked that night, the three of them gathered in the geology lab.

Hassan studied the crystal's image on his screen. The way it seemed to hold depth beyond its physical dimensions.

"Explorers," he said. "Like us. Looking for something they never found."

"How do you know they didn't find it?"

"Because they left this behind. A marker. A message. A warning." Hassan zoomed in on the wall symbols. "They wanted someone to know they were here."

"Then we honor that." Alexis stood. "We document it properly. We study it carefully. We don't let Earth Corp bury it in classification."

Hassan smiled. "Agreed."

Outside, the Martian night was cold and dark and filled with ancient secrets.

They'd found one.

It wouldn't be the last.
