The drill bit screamed through regolith at 0600 hours. Alexis stood in the subsurface tunnel, monitoring cavity responses while Omar managed the drilling operation from the geology lab.

"Depth point-five meters," the drill operator reported. "Resistance nominal."

On Alexis's scanner, the cavity's pulse remained steady. Fifteen beats per minute. Temperature unchanged. Whatever was down there, it hadn't noticed them yet.

Or was waiting to see what they'd do.

"Depth one meter," the operator called. "Encountering harder substrate. Adjusting torque."

The drill's pitch shifted. Alexis felt the vibration through her boots—a deep thrumming that resonated in her chest. The cavity pulsed once, sharply, then returned to baseline.

"Omar, did you see that spike?"

"Confirmed. Temperature jumped half a degree." Omar's voice was tight over the comm. "It knows we're coming."

"Continue drilling," Alexis said. "Slow and steady."

The operator reduced speed. The drill bit chewed through rock with methodical precision. Alexis watched the depth gauge tick upward—one-point-two meters, one-point-five, one-point-eight.

The cavity pulsed again. Faster now. Seventeen beats per minute.

"It's accelerating," Omar reported.

"Acknowledged. Keep monitoring."

At two meters depth, the drill hit something different. The resistance changed—not harder, but denser. The operator adjusted again, compensating for the new material.

"What is this stuff?" he muttered. "Feels like drilling through metal."

Alexis checked the spectroscopic readings. The composition was wrong—too much iron, crystalline structure unlike any native Martian rock. The same anomalous readings that had flagged the cavity in the first place.

"Depth two-point-five meters," the operator said. "Approaching cavity wall."

The cavity's pulse spiked to twenty beats per minute. Temperature rising. Alexis felt sweat prickle her neck despite the cool air.

"Slow down," she ordered. "Final approach at minimum speed."

The drill bit touched the cavity wall.

Every alarm in Alexis's scanner triggered simultaneously. The cavity's pulse jumped to thirty beats per minute. Temperature spiked four degrees. The walls contracted, then expanded, creating pressure waves that registered on the seismic monitors.

"It's panicking," Omar said.

"Or preparing to defend itself." Alexis's hand hovered over the emergency shutdown. "Operator, hold position. Don't penetrate the wall yet."

They waited. The drill bit rested against the cavity's surface, spinning slowly. Around them, the tunnel was silent except for the drill's electric whine.

The cavity pulsed. Thirty-five beats per minute now. Alexis could feel it through the rock—a rapid-fire rhythm that felt almost like communication.

"It's afraid," she said quietly.

"Or angry," Omar countered. "We're invading its space."

Alexis pulled up her tablet and typed a message to Rivera: Cavity responding to drilling operation. Possible sentience. Requesting guidance.

Rivera's response came back in ten seconds: Your call. But if it's intelligent, we need to know.

Alexis looked at the drill operator. Young guy, maybe twenty-five, signed up for Mars because Earth didn't offer him better options. He was watching her, waiting for orders.

"Penetrate the wall," Alexis said. "Five centimeters, then stop."

The operator engaged the drill. The bit pushed through the cavity wall with surprising ease—the material was dense but brittle. At exactly five centimeters depth, he stopped.

The cavity's response was immediate. The pulse rate dropped to zero. Temperature flatlined. The seismic monitors went silent.

"Omar?" Alexis's voice was tight.

"I'm seeing it. Total cessation of activity." Omar paused. "Either it's dead, or it's holding its breath."

Alexis waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Thirty.

Then the cavity pulsed once. Slow. Deliberate. The temperature rose one degree. The walls contracted in a single synchronized movement.

And Alexis's scanner picked up something new—a low-frequency electromagnetic signature emanating from the cavity. Not random noise. Structured. Patterned.

"Omar, are you recording this?"

"Every sensor I have. That's not geological activity. That's—"

"Communication."

The electromagnetic pattern repeated. Same frequency, same structure. A message in a language they didn't understand from a presence that predated their arrival by unknown years.

Mars was speaking.

Alexis pulled out the heat exchange coil assembly. The plan was simple—insert the coils through the drill hole, activate the thermal transfer system, tap the cavity's heat. Standard engineering.

But this wasn't standard anymore.

"Operator, I need you to send something down the drill shaft." Alexis handed him a small thermal probe. "Gently. Don't force it."

The probe slid through the drill hole and into the cavity. On her scanner, Alexis watched it descend into the spherical space. The cavity pulsed once, examining the intrusion.

Then something impossible happened. The cavity's temperature dropped two degrees. The heat concentrated around the probe, warming it. The electromagnetic signal changed pitch, modulating in response to the probe's presence.

"It's showing us its heat," Omar said, awed. "It understood what we need."

Alexis felt goosebumps rise on her arms. They'd come to Mars to establish human presence, extract resources, prove that colonization was possible.

They'd found a neighbor instead.

"Pull the probe," she ordered. "Carefully."

The operator retrieved the probe. It emerged warm to the touch, visibly heated by the cavity's deliberate energy transfer.

Alexis sealed the drill hole with polymer plug. Not permanent, but respectful. A way to say: we're pausing, we're thinking, we're not just taking.

"Omar, I need a xenobiologist. Or a linguist. Or someone who knows how to talk to an intelligence that speaks in electromagnetic pulses."

"We don't have anyone like that. This is an engineering colony."

"Then we improvise." Alexis headed for the command center. "Because we're not alone on Mars, and we need to figure out what that means before Earth Corp decides to drill a hundred holes looking for thermal resources."

Rivera listened to Alexis's report without interrupting. When she finished, the commander sat back in her chair.

"You're telling me there's an intelligent presence under Hab Three."

"I'm telling you there's something responsive, aware, and capable of communication. Whether that qualifies as intelligent by our definition—" Alexis shrugged. "We need more data."

"Earth Corp won't care about definitions. They'll want to know if it's exploitable."

"Which is exactly why we need to understand it first." Alexis leaned forward. "If this presence is native to Mars, if it's been here for millennia, we have an ethical obligation to—"

"To what? Leave? We've invested everything in this colony."

"To coexist." Alexis pulled up the thermal data. "It offered us heat. Voluntarily. That's cooperation, not hostility."

Rivera was quiet, weighing options. Outside the viewport, Mars turned under its thin atmosphere, keeping secrets humanity was only beginning to discover.

"Continue monitoring," Rivera said finally. "Limited contact only. And Alexis? This doesn't leave this room. If the crew finds out there's something alive under our feet—"

"They deserve to know."

"They deserve to not panic while we figure out what this means."

Alexis wanted to argue. But Rivera was right. The colony was stressed enough without adding xenobiology to the crisis list.

She returned to the subsurface tunnel. The drill was silent, the polymer plug sealing the connection to the cavity. But Alexis could feel it down there—pulsing, waiting, aware.

Mars had welcomed them with radiation and dust storms and equipment failures. Now it was offering something different.

A chance to listen. A chance to learn. A chance to prove humanity could be something better than just extractors and exploiters.

Alexis placed her palm against the tunnel wall. Three meters of rock separated her from first contact with Martian intelligence.

"We hear you," she whispered. "We're listening."

The cavity pulsed once. Slow. Steady. Patient.

And Alexis wondered if they'd been the ones contacted all along.
