Station Director Kwame Nkrumah reviewed the final agreement and felt something he rarely experienced: hope.

The partition had been signed. European Federation and Pacific Alliance both accepting terms. Station Unity designated as neutral arbiter for future disputes.

Humanity had chosen negotiation over war.

For now.

"Director." Ambassador Wu appeared in his office. "Both delegations are preparing departure. I wanted to thank you personally."

"For what? I just provided the venue."

"You provided more than that. You made this place safe enough that both sides could talk honestly. That's not a small thing."

Kwame pulled up the station's security logs. Two assassination attempts. One bombing. Three acts of sabotage. All stopped before escalation.

"We almost lost it a dozen times," he said.

"But we didn't. That's what matters." Chen sat across from him. "I've been doing this for thirty years. Most negotiations fail. This one succeeded. Because Station Unity lived up to its name."

"Until the next crisis."

"There will always be a next crisis. That's why stations like this exist. To give humanity a place to solve problems instead of shooting each other."

Kwame thought about the founding charter. Station Unity established as neutral ground. No national affiliations. No corporate ownership. Just space where factions could meet on equal footing.

It had seemed idealistic when he'd signed on as director. Now it felt essential.

"What's next for you?" Kwame asked.

"Another negotiation. Mars water rights. Should be fun." Chen's tone was ironic. "And you?"

"Rebuilding. We took damage from the bombing. Need repairs. Security upgrades. And probably psychiatric counseling for half the station personnel."

"Hazards of the job."

They sat in comfortable silence. Two people who'd spent weeks managing crisis. Who'd prevented war through procedural competence and sheer stubbornness.

"Chen. Why do you do this? The negotiations. The politics. All of it."

Chen thought about it. "Because someone has to. Because without spaces like this, without people willing to mediate, humanity defaults to violence. I'd rather spend my life talking people out of wars than watching wars happen because nobody talked."

"That's more idealistic than I expected."

"I've seen enough conflict to know what it costs. This—" Chen gestured at the station "—costs less. In lives. In resources. In humanity's future."

After Chen left, Kwame pulled up the damage reports. Section twelve still needed hull repairs. Life support in the affected areas was operating on backup systems. And they'd lost three people.

The cost of peace negotiations.

He thought about Marcus Webb. Station maintenance worker who'd died detonating a bomb. Who'd been compromised by outside interests. Who'd chosen his action knowing it would kill him.

Kwame wondered what Webb had been promised. What debt or threat had driven him to sabotage.

The investigation would continue. Follow the money. Track the conspiracy. Try to prevent the next Webb from succeeding.

But perfect security was impossible. Station Unity hosted factions with conflicting interests. Someone would always want negotiations to fail.

The job was making failure harder than success.

Kwame pulled up the repair schedule. Six weeks to restore full operations. Three months to implement enhanced security. Constant vigilance to maintain neutrality.

The work never stopped.

His terminal chimed. Incoming delegation request. Mars water rights negotiation. Two weeks from now.

Kwame accepted the request and started preparing.

Because this is what Station Unity did. Provide space for talking. For negotiating. For choosing peaceful resolution over violent default.

One negotiation at a time.

One war prevented.

One small step toward a future where humanity solved problems without killing each other.

Kwame stood at the observation port. Outside, ships came and went. Commerce. Diplomacy. The constant flow of humanity expanding into space.

And somewhere in that flow, factions that would rather fight than talk. Interests that profited from conflict. People who wanted Station Unity to fail.

His job was proving them wrong.

By keeping the station open. Keeping the channels clear. Keeping the neutral ground neutral.

It wasn't glamorous. It wasn't heroic.

But it mattered.

And that was enough.

Kwame returned to his desk and pulled up the repair logistics. Work orders. Resource allocation. The endless administrative tasks that kept a station functioning.

This was the real work of peace. Not dramatic speeches or heroic sacrifices. Just steady competence. Reliable systems. A place where people could meet without fear.

Station Unity.

Living up to its name.

One negotiation at a time.
