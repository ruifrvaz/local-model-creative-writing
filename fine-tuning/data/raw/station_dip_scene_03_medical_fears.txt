The medical bay was quiet at 1900 hours. Dr. Sarah Okonkwo preferred it that way—gave her time to think without the constant interruption of station personnel with minor injuries and stress complaints.

She was prepping trauma supplies when Kwame appeared in the doorway.

"You expecting casualties?" he asked.

"I'm expecting humans under pressure to make poor decisions." Sarah organized surgical kits with practiced efficiency. "Two hostile delegations, confined space, political stakes that could trigger war. Someone's going to get hurt. Question is whether it's accidental or deliberate."

Kwame moved into the bay, his footsteps soft on the medical-grade flooring. "Chen wants you on standby during negotiations. Medical observer."

"I'm not a diplomat."

"You're a doctor who's worked conflict zones. You know what violence looks like before it happens." Kwame pulled up a chair. "And you're good at reading people."

Sarah set down the surgical kit. "What are you really asking?"

"I'm asking if you'll watch both delegations and tell me which one's planning something we can't see yet."

"That's not medicine."

"It's triage. Identify the most critical threat so we can treat it before people die." Kwame's expression was tired. "I've run Unity Station for six years without a major incident. I'd like to keep that record."

Sarah considered. She'd come to Unity precisely because it was neutral territory—no political complications, no choosing sides, just medical practice without the weight of Earth's politics or the colonies' grievances.

But neutrality was becoming harder to maintain when both sides were arming for conflict.

"I'll observe," she said. "Medical capacity only. I'm not making political assessments."

"Good enough."

After Kwame left, Sarah continued her preparations. Extra blood supplies, bioprinters loaded with universal tissue substrate, emergency surgical suite prepped and ready. The bay could handle twenty critical patients simultaneously if needed.

She hoped that was overkill.

Her comm chirped. "Medical, we have a situation in section four."

Sarah grabbed her kit. "Details?"

"Coalition delegate, respiratory distress. Security is on site."

She reached section four in under three minutes. Lena Volkov stood outside a quarters module, her expression controlled but alert. Inside, a man sat on a bench, breathing hard, his face flushed.

"What happened?" Sarah asked, moving past security.

"Unknown. He collapsed during equipment setup." Lena stepped aside. "Name's David Park, Coalition technical advisor."

Sarah scanned Park with her medical tablet. Heart rate elevated but regular. Blood oxygen dropping. Respiratory pattern suggested panic response rather than physiological failure.

"Mr. Park, I'm Dr. Okonkwo. Can you tell me what you're feeling?"

"Can't... breathe." He gasped between words. "Something... wrong with air."

Sarah checked the atmospheric monitors. Oxygen at standard 21%, no contaminants detected, pressure normal. "The air is fine. I need you to slow your breathing. In through your nose, hold for three seconds, out through your mouth."

"Not... panic attack." Park's eyes were wide. "Been... poisoned."

"Your biometrics don't show toxin exposure." Sarah pulled out a medical injector. "I'm giving you a mild sedative to help your breathing normalize. It won't affect your mental clarity."

"No drugs!" Park jerked away. "Could be... compromise."

Sarah understood. He thought someone was trying to incapacitate him. Make him vulnerable.

"Lena, clear the room," she said quietly.

The security chief herded Coalition personnel into the corridor. Sarah closed the door and sat beside Park.

"I'm not going to force medication. But I need you to tell me what you actually think is happening."

Park's breathing slowed slightly. "We received... intelligence. Saboteur aboard station. Targeting negotiations."

"From whom?"

"Can't say. But credible." He met her eyes. "Someone wants these talks to fail. Violently."

Sarah felt cold certainty settle in her chest. "Does your delegation chief know?"

"Yes. That's why we're installing... enhanced security." Park gestured at the equipment scattered around the room. "Trying to protect ourselves."

"And you think someone tried to poison you to stop that work?"

"Don't know what to think. Just know something's wrong."

Sarah ran another scan. Park's vitals were stabilizing, the panic response fading. No evidence of chemical or biological agents. But that didn't mean the threat wasn't real—just that it hadn't manifested yet.

"I'm going to recommend you rest for two hours," she said. "Let your system normalize. If you have another episode, I'll do a full toxicology workup."

"Can't rest. Work to finish."

"Then let your team finish it. You're no good to anyone if you're compromised." Sarah stood. "And Mr. Park? If you have intelligence about a saboteur, you need to share it with station security. Director Nkrumah can't protect people from threats he doesn't know about."

Park looked torn. "Official channels... might be compromised."

"Lena Volkov isn't an official channel. She's a professional who's kept this station secure for three years." Sarah moved toward the door. "Talk to her. Or don't. But understand that secrecy might be what gets people killed."

She found Lena in the corridor, monitoring feeds on her tablet.

"Assessment?" the security chief asked.

"Panic attack triggered by stress and paranoia. But the paranoia might be justified." Sarah lowered her voice. "He claims Coalition received intelligence about a saboteur targeting the negotiations."

Lena's expression didn't change, but her eyes sharpened. "Credible?"

"He believes it. Whether it's real or disinformation is your department."

"Mars delegation has been quiet. Too quiet." Lena pulled up surveillance feeds. "Either they're genuinely here to negotiate, or they're very good at operational security."

"Could the saboteur be from neither delegation?"

"Could be anyone. Could be already aboard, posing as station crew. Could be arriving with the journalists requesting credentials." Lena switched feeds. "Could be me, for all you know."

Sarah studied her. "Are you?"

"If I was, would I tell you?" Lena's smile was thin. "That's the problem with sabotage. Trust becomes a luxury no one can afford."

Sarah returned to medical bay, her mind working through scenarios. A saboteur could strike anywhere—life support, station structure, communication systems. Or they could target individuals, making it look like natural causes or accidents.

She pulled up medical records for all station personnel and both delegations. Looking for patterns, vulnerabilities, anything that might indicate who was at risk.

The Coalition delegation had arrived early. Mars matched the timing. Both were installing secure equipment. Both were operating on incomplete information and elevated threat assessment.

The perfect conditions for a cascade failure where everyone's security measures became mutual escalation until something broke.

Sarah organized her trauma supplies again, adding biohazard protocols to the standard emergency response. If the saboteur used chemical or biological agents, she'd need containment procedures ready.

Her comm chirped. Kwame's voice: "Medical status?"

"Green. One panic response in section four, resolved. Patient stable."

"Good. Chen's meeting with Coalition in thirty minutes. Stand by in case anything develops."

Sarah pulled up the conference room feeds on her medical monitor. She could watch from here, observe both delegations during preliminary discussions, look for signs of physical or psychological stress that might indicate who knew what about the threat.

This wasn't what she'd signed up for when she took the Unity position. But it was what the job required now.

She checked her medical kit one more time, then settled in to watch.

Waiting for the crisis she knew was coming.
