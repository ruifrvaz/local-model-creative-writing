Medical Director James Okoye ran the genetic analysis for the fifth time.

The results didn't improve.

Generation Ship Endurance's population showed bottleneck effects. Eight thousand people descended from the original crew. Two hundred years of breeding in isolation.

Genetic diversity was declining. Recessive disorders increasing. Immune function weakening.

Not catastrophic. Not yet. But the trend was clear.

Another two hundred years might push them past viability. Or might not. The models disagreed.

He pulled up comparative data. Earth populations. Colony worlds. Previous generation ships.

All showed similar patterns. But Endurance's isolation was more extreme. Eight thousand people with no genetic input. No fresh diversity. Just careful breeding programs that couldn't prevent inevitable drift.

Captain Ana Reyes entered medical bay. "You wanted to see me?"

"I need to update the genetic projections. For the council presentation."

"How bad?"

Okoye pulled up the models. "Depends on assumptions. Worst case, we're unviable in one-fifty years. Best case, we maintain marginal viability through careful breeding management."

"And realistic case?"

"We limp to Tau Ceti with increased health problems. Establish colony with compromised immune function and elevated genetic disorder rates." Okoye highlighted the uncertainty ranges. "But these are projections, Ana. Not certainties."

"The council needs certainties. Or at least strong probabilities."

"Science doesn't work that way. We model scenarios. Estimate risks. Hope reality falls within our error bars."

Ana studied the data. "The vote is tomorrow. Your presentation could swing the decision."

"Which is why I'm asking: what do you want me to say?"

"I want you to say the truth."

"The truth is uncertain. We might be fine. We might not be. Settling the planet is safer in terms of genetic diversity. But riskier in every other way."

Ana sat down. "Off the record. What would you do?"

Okoye thought about his children. Born on Endurance. Third generation. Their children would be fourth. And their children's children—

Would they exist? Would Endurance's population survive long enough?

"I'd settle," he said quietly. "The planet's not perfect. But it's real. Known risks instead of projected ones. I'd take that trade."

"Even knowing you'd be betraying the mission?"

"The mission was designed by people who didn't understand multi-generational effects. Who couldn't predict genetic drift. Who thought four hundred years was manageable because the math said so."

"The math was wrong?"

"The math was incomplete. It didn't account for human complexity. For the thousand variables that emerge over centuries." Okoye pulled up the breeding program data. "We've done everything right. Genetic counseling. Careful partner selection. Diversity preservation protocols. And we're still declining. Slowly. But measurably."

Ana was quiet. Then: "Tomorrow, you present the data. Just the data. Let the council interpret it."

"They'll see what they want to see."

"Then make sure they see everything. All the uncertainty. All the risk. Both directions."

Okoye nodded. "I can do that."

The council chamber filled slowly. Eight thousand people couldn't attend, but representatives covered every department. Every interest group. Every philosophical faction.

Okoye's presentation was scheduled after the navigation report and before the resource assessment.

He pulled up his slides. Genetic diversity metrics. Health trend analysis. Breeding program effectiveness.

All technical. All factual. All terrifying in implication.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief. Our population shows bottleneck effects consistent with isolated breeding pools. Genetic diversity is declining at approximately point-three percent per generation."

Murmurs from the assembly. Someone called out: "Is that dangerous?"

"At current rates? Manageable. We can maintain viable population through the original mission timeline. Barely. With increased health interventions and aggressive breeding management."

"And if rates accelerate?"

"Then we have problems. Potentially catastrophic ones." Okoye pulled up the projection curves. "These models show a range of outcomes. Best case, we maintain current diversity. Worst case, we experience genetic collapse within one-fifty years."

"What determines which case we experience?"

"Random chance. Environmental factors. Breeding program compliance. A thousand variables we can't control."

The assembly was quiet. Processing. Calculating.

Historian Eva Sato stood. "Director Okoye, what's the probability of worst-case outcome?"

"Fifteen percent. Maybe twenty. The models aren't precise."

"And best case?"

"Thirty percent. With most likely outcome somewhere in the middle."

"So we probably survive. But not comfortably."

"Correct. We'll arrive at Tau Ceti with elevated health problems. Compromised immune function. Increased genetic disorder rates. But viable. Probably."

"Versus settling the planet?"

"Immediate genetic diversification. The planet's biosphere will challenge our immune systems. Expose us to new pathogens. Force adaptation. That's dangerous short-term. But beneficial long-term."

Engineer Malik Torres stood. "You're saying the planet could kill us or save us."

"I'm saying new environments create evolutionary pressure. We either adapt or we don't. But if we adapt, we become stronger."

"And if we don't?"

Okoye didn't sugarcoat it. "Then settlement fails. We lose population. Possibly retreat to the Endurance and continue to Tau Ceti with reduced numbers."

The assembly erupted in discussion. Arguments. Calculations.

Okoye let them debate. His job was data, not decisions.

After an hour, Captain Reyes called for order. "Director Okoye, final question. Do you recommend settlement?"

"As a medical director? Yes. The genetic benefits outweigh the risks. But I'm biased. I want my children to have choices beyond this ship."

"Understood. Thank you."

Okoye returned to his seat. The presentation had gone as well as possible. All data presented. All uncertainties acknowledged.

The vote would happen tomorrow. Eight thousand people deciding their collective future.

He couldn't predict the outcome. Could only hope they chose wisely.

That night, Okoye couldn't sleep. He ran additional models. Explored alternative scenarios.

What if they settled and the environment was more hostile than projected? What if disease killed half the population?

What if they continued to Tau Ceti and genetic collapse happened faster than models suggested?

Every choice had risks. Every decision could be wrong.

That was the burden of leadership. Making choices without certainty. Living with consequences.

His son found him in medical bay at 0300 hours. Seven years old. Too young to vote. But not too young to care.

"Dad, are we going to land on the planet?"

"Maybe. The vote's tomorrow."

"Do you want to land?"

Okoye thought about lying. Giving the safe answer. But his son deserved truth.

"Yes. I want you to run on grass. To see weather. To have a world instead of just a ship."

"Will it be dangerous?"

"Yes. But staying on Endurance is dangerous too. Different risks. Not necessarily smaller ones."

His son thought about that. Then: "I want to see the planet. Even if it's scary."

Okoye hugged him. "Then let's hope the council agrees."

The next day, the vote came in. Settlement by narrow margin.

Okoye felt relief and terror in equal measure. They'd chosen planetary life. Accepted the risks. Committed to adaptation.

Now came the hard part. Actually surviving contact with an alien biosphere.

He pulled up environmental protocols. Disease monitoring. Quarantine procedures. Medical intervention strategies.

Eight thousand people about to stake their lives on his ability to keep them healthy in an unknown environment.

No pressure.

Just the future of the colony depending on his competence.

He got to work. Time for modeling was over. Time for action had begun.

The planet waited. Dangerous. Unknown. Full of possibilities.

And Okoye would make damn sure his people survived it.
