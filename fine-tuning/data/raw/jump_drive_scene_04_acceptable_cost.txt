Lieutenant Sarah Chen floated in the modified test ship, watching quantum fields build around her.

The expanded Alcubierre bubble. Dr. Yamamoto's solution to temporal drift. Theoretical improvement based on mathematics that might be wrong.

She was about to find out which.

"Neural monitors online," Dr. Mbara reported. "I'm reading clear signals. You're good to proceed."

Sarah checked her instruments. The bubble was different. Larger. More diffuse. She felt more isolated from its boundary.

Maybe that would help. Maybe it wouldn't.

"Initiating jump in three. Two. One."

Reality folded differently this time. The sensation was smoother. Less jarring. The boundary effects more distant.

She traveled four light-years in ninety seconds. Emerged at Proxima Centauri feeling... normal.

"Alcubierre's Dream, this is Control. Reading your arrival. Time displacement: two seconds."

Two seconds. Down from four. The modification worked.

Sarah felt hope for the first time in weeks. "Preparing return jump."

The trip back was equally smooth. The expanded bubble isolated her from the worst quantum effects.

"Return displacement: three seconds total."

Three seconds for round trip. Compared to thirteen seconds previously. A seventy-five percent reduction.

Yamamoto's voice over the comm was excited. "It worked. The expanded bubble reduces temporal drift significantly."

"But doesn't eliminate it," Sarah noted. "I still lost three seconds."

"But at reduced rate. Fifty jumps would cost you one-fifty seconds. Under three minutes total. Manageable."

Sarah ran the math. Three minutes of missing time versus potential hours with the old configuration. It was better. Significantly better.

But still a cost. Still consciousness gaps accumulating.

"I want to do another test," she said. "Longer jump. Verify the drift pattern holds."

"Sarah, you've done two jumps today. Dr. Mbara recommends rest between—"

"I'm fine. And we need the data. How far can I jump?"

Yamamoto pulled up star charts. "Barnard's Star. Six light-years. If the drift scales linearly, you'd lose approximately four-five seconds."

"Then let's verify."

She jumped to Barnard's Star. The bubble held. The transition smooth. Five seconds of drift.

Back to the test facility. Another five seconds gone.

Ten seconds total. For twelve light-years traveled.

The pattern was consistent. Drift reduced but not eliminated. Manageable but accumulating.

Admiral Kowalski reviewed the data personally. "This is acceptable. We can work with this drift rate."

"For how long?" Sarah asked.

"Indefinitely. Ten seconds per twelve light-years is negligible. You could jump thousands of times before accumulating meaningful consciousness gaps."

"Thousands of small gaps. Does that equal one large gap? Or something different?"

"Unknown. But it's better than what we had." Kowalski pulled up the program timeline. "We proceed to commercial demonstration. Show corporate partners the technology works."

Sarah felt uncertain. The drift was reduced. But not eliminated. They were still stealing time from pilots. Just less time. More slowly.

Was that good enough?

Dr. Mbara pulled her aside after the briefing. "How do you feel? Actually feel, not what you think you should say."

"Tired. But functional. The gaps are smaller. Less noticeable."

"But they're there."

"Yes. Moments I can't account for. Probably just seconds. But I should remember those seconds and I don't."

Mbara ran her neural scans. "Your consciousness pattern is stable. No signs of fragmentation. The expanded bubble is protecting you better."

"But not perfectly."

"Nothing is perfect. We accept imperfections in everything. Why should jump technology be different?"

Sarah thought about that. Every technology had costs. Cars produced pollution. Nuclear power generated waste. Space travel exposed crews to radiation.

They accepted those costs because the benefits outweighed them.

Was temporal drift just another acceptable cost? A small price for faster-than-light travel?

Or was it something more? A fundamental violation of consciousness that they'd learn to regret?

She didn't know. Couldn't know.

She only knew she'd volunteer for more jumps. Because the technology mattered. Because exploration mattered.

Because three minutes of lost time was worth pushing humanity to the stars.

Even if someday, those missing minutes added up to something she couldn't recover.

The commercial demonstration happened two weeks later. Corporate partners. Military observers. Political representatives.

Sarah jumped to Alpha Centauri and back. Round trip, nine light-years. Subjective time: three minutes. Objective time: three minutes, seven seconds.

Seven seconds of temporal drift. In front of everyone who mattered.

The response was immediate. Contracts signed. Funding approved. Production timelines established.

Jump drive technology was officially viable.

Sarah watched the celebration from the observation deck. Everyone excited. Everyone convinced they'd solved the problem.

And they had. Mostly.

Except for the seconds she'd lost. The gaps in continuous awareness. The pieces of her life that existed in quantum superposition and never collapsed.

Dr. Yamamoto joined her. "You're not celebrating."

"I'm thinking about the pilots who come after me. The commercial operators who'll make thousands of jumps. Accumulating seconds. Minutes. Maybe hours."

"They'll know the risks. Make informed choices."

"Will they? Or will they accept it because everyone says it's fine? Because the drift is manageable? Because progress demands sacrifice?"

Yamamoto didn't answer immediately. Then: "I don't know. But Sarah, you've given us the data. How people use it is their choice."

"Even if that choice costs them pieces of themselves?"

"Even then. We can't protect people from their own decisions. We can only give them information and trust they'll choose wisely."

Sarah wasn't sure that was enough. But it was all they had.

She returned to her quarters. Pulled up her personal logs. Documenting every jump. Every second of drift. Every gap in continuous awareness.

Seventeen jumps total. Thirty-eight seconds missing.

Not much. Barely noticeable. Just fragments scattered across her timeline.

But those fragments were hers. Parts of her life she'd never recover. Experiences that existed and didn't exist simultaneously.

The cost of being humanity's first faster-than-light pilot.

A cost she'd accepted. Would accept again. Even knowing what it meant.

Because some things mattered more than continuous awareness.

Like exploration. Discovery. Pushing boundaries nobody else would.

Even if those boundaries pushed back. Taking pieces of consciousness one quantum moment at a time.

Sarah closed her logs and tried to sleep.

Dreaming of stars she'd visit. Gaps she'd accumulate. The price of speed that everyone would eventually pay.

One jump at a time. One second at a time.

Until faster-than-light became as normal as driving. As accepted as any technology.

And the pilots who'd paid the cost became footnotes. Interesting historical details. People who'd sacrificed so others could travel.

She could live with that. Had to live with that.

Because the alternative was staying still. Accepting limits.

And Sarah Chen had never accepted limits.

Even when they cost her fragments of herself.
