The first child born on Mars arrived at 0347 hours on a Tuesday.

Dr. Hassan wasn't an obstetrician, but he'd studied the procedures. Mars colony needed medical versatility. Everyone wore multiple hats.

Especially during emergencies like premature birth.

"Contractions are two minutes apart," he said, monitoring Sarah Reeves's vitals. Daniel's wife, evacuated from Earth three months ago, eight months pregnant and not supposed to deliver for another four weeks.

Mars had other plans.

"I need an epidural," Sarah gasped between contractions.

"We don't have one. Just local anesthetic and basic pain medication." Hassan prepared the injection. "This will take the edge off."

"It's too early. The baby's not ready."

"The baby disagrees." Hassan kept his voice calm. "Your vitals are good. Baby's heartbeat is strong. This can work."

Chen—the engineering Chen—stood by with sterilized equipment. Yuki monitored oxygen levels. They'd converted a storage room into a makeshift delivery room because the medical bay wasn't designed for childbirth.

Mars rarely cooperated with human plans.

Another contraction hit. Sarah screamed, her hand crushing Chen's fingers.

"You're doing great," Hassan lied. Truth was, he had no idea. Textbook knowledge and simulations couldn't prepare him for the reality of bringing new life into the world.

Especially not on Mars.

"I can see the head," he reported. "Sarah, on the next contraction, I need you to push."

She nodded, sweat beading her face. The contraction built, and she pushed with everything she had.

Progress. Slow. Painful. Inexorable.

"Again. Keep pushing."

Time lost meaning. Contractions blurred together. Sarah's strength flagged, then surged again with each wave.

And then, suddenly, the baby was there. Tiny. Red. Screaming with magnificent fury at being forced into existence.

Hassan cleared the airway and placed the infant on Sarah's chest. "It's a girl."

Sarah sobbed, her hands cradling the baby with desperate gentleness. "She's okay? Really okay?"

Hassan ran quick assessments. Heart rate elevated but strong. Breathing well despite the premature delivery. Color improving as oxygen saturated her blood.

"She's perfect," he said honestly.

Chen cut the umbilical cord with hands that shook. Yuki wrapped mother and baby in warm blankets. They worked in silent coordination, everyone understanding the magnitude of what just happened.

Mars's first native.

The door opened. Daniel Reeves rushed in, his face pale. "I heard—is she—"

"She's fine. They're both fine." Hassan stepped back, giving the family space.

Daniel knelt beside Sarah, tears streaming down his face. He touched the baby's tiny hand, and she gripped his finger with surprising strength.

"What's her name?" Hassan asked.

Sarah looked at Daniel, who nodded. "Elena. Elena Mars Reeves."

Hassan felt emotion tighten his throat. Elena. After the colony's founder who'd died on Mars two hundred years ago, according to their chosen mythology.

Except this Elena would live here. Grow here. Maybe die here eventually, but after a full life under Martian sky.

The first of many.

News spread through the colony within minutes. People gathered outside the makeshift delivery room, waiting for their first glimpse of Mars's newest resident.

Rivera arrived and peered through the observation window. "How's our pioneer?"

"Three point two kilograms. Healthy lungs. Doesn't appreciate Martian gravity yet." Hassan checked his monitors. "We'll need to watch her carefully. Premature birth in reduced gravity presents unique challenges."

"We'll figure it out. We always do."

Rivera was right. They would. Because that's what Mars demanded—constant adaptation, endless problem-solving, solutions to challenges nobody had faced before.

Hassan prepared the post-delivery care station. Infant monitoring equipment salvaged from storage and repurposed. Heating elements to maintain temperature. Oxygen sensors to ensure proper saturation.

Everything makeshift. Everything functional. Everything good enough.

Mars's medicine in a nutshell.

"Can we see her?" someone called from the corridor.

Hassan looked at Sarah, who nodded tiredly. He opened the door, and the colony filed through in small groups. Two hundred adults, many who'd never seen a newborn, all crowding around to witness the miracle.

Elena slept through the attention, blissfully unaware that she'd just become the most important person on Mars.

"She's so small," Yuki whispered.

"She'll grow," Hassan said. "Probably faster in reduced gravity. We'll need to monitor bone density and muscle development. Completely uncharted territory."

"You worried?"

"Terrified. But that's normal for Mars."

The visitation continued for hours. Eventually, Rivera cleared the room and let the family rest. Hassan established monitoring protocols and scheduled regular check-ups.

Then he collapsed in his quarters, exhausted and exhilarated.

He'd delivered a baby. On Mars. Successfully.

Medicine on Earth had procedures, specialists, equipment for every contingency. Mars had improvisation and determination.

Somehow, that was enough.

A week later, Hassan found Sarah in the common area, Elena sleeping in her arms while other colonists cooed and offered advice.

"How's motherhood on Mars?" he asked.

"Terrifying. Wonderful. Exhausting." Sarah smiled down at Elena. "She's already stronger than Earth babies. The gravity makes everything easier for her."

"We'll need to watch her development closely."

"I know. But Hassan? Thank you. For everything."

He nodded, uncomfortable with gratitude. "I just followed procedures."

"You saved our lives. Both of us."

Hassan thought about the delivery. How many things could have gone wrong. How many complications he'd trained for but never expected to face.

"We got lucky," he said.

"We had you. That's better than luck."

After Sarah left, Hassan pulled up his medical notes. Elena's development needed tracking. Bone density, muscle tone, neurological development—all potentially affected by growing up in Martian gravity.

She'd be different from Earth children. Adapted to Mars in ways humans had never experienced.

The first of a new generation. Native Martians.

Hassan started a research protocol. Long-term health tracking. Developmental milestones. Genetic expression in low gravity. Everything humanity would need to understand if Mars was to become a permanent home.

Elena would be the first data point. Not the last.

Other families were already planning pregnancies. Mars's population would grow, one birth at a time.

Hassan felt the weight of responsibility settle on his shoulders. These children would depend on him for care, guidance, medical expertise in territory no human had explored.

He'd do his best. Study. Adapt. Learn from each case.

Same as everything on Mars.

Elena Mars Reeves slept in her mother's arms, unaware that she'd changed everything.

Mars was no longer just a colony. It was home to someone who'd never known anything else.

That made all the difference.

Hassan returned to work, planning for a future where Martian children were normal.

Where Mars was just another place humans lived.

Starting with one tiny girl who didn't know she was making history.

She just knew she was home.

And that was enough.
