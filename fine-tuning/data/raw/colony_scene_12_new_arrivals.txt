The new arrivals looked terrified. Fifteen people fresh from Earth, stepping off the transport shuttle with wide eyes and shaky legs.

Alexis remembered that feeling. The first glimpse of Mars through a viewport. The realization that you'd left Earth's comfortable gravity for a world that wanted you dead.

"Welcome to Ares Colony," Rivera said, her voice carrying authority and warmth in equal measure. "I'm Commander Rivera. My team will get you oriented and settled."

The new crew clustered together like frightened animals. Alexis didn't blame them. The habitat was cramped, the air smelled recycled, and every surface showed signs of constant repair.

Not exactly the gleaming future corporate recruiters promised.

One man stepped forward. Tall, confident, clearly designated as the group's leader. "Daniel Reeves. Mining operations supervisor. Corporate sent us to establish preliminary extraction protocols."

"Understood. We've prepared quarters in dome two." Rivera gestured to Chen. "Engineer Chen will show you the facilities."

Reeves looked around the landing bay with barely concealed disdain. "This is the main habitat?"

"One of three domes. We're expanding as resources allow."

"Corporate's projections showed capacity for five hundred personnel by this point. There's maybe two hundred here."

"Projections assumed equipment functioned as specified and Mars cooperated with our timeline." Rivera's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Neither happened. We adapt."

Reeves made a note on his tablet. "I'll need to file a report with corporate. They'll want to know why construction is behind schedule."

Alexis felt her jaw tighten. They'd been on Mars less than ten minutes and already complaining about schedules.

"File whatever reports you need," Rivera said calmly. "In the meantime, my crew will ensure you survive long enough to send them. Chen?"

Chen led the new arrivals toward dome two. Alexis watched them go, their expensive EVA suits still factory-clean, their equipment tags unscratched by Martian dust.

"They're going to be a problem," she said.

"Give them a week. Mars has a way of adjusting attitudes." Rivera pulled up the colony roster. "We'll need to integrate them carefully. Can't have corporate's people undermining colony operations."

"What if they try?"

"Then we educate them on Mars priorities. Survival first. Politics never."

The next morning, Alexis found Reeves in the engineering bay, examining the power distribution systems with mounting disapproval.

"This is barely functional," he said without preamble.

"It's perfectly functional. Just old."

"Old is generous. This equipment should've been replaced three years ago."

"We've requested replacements. Corporate keeps delaying approval."

Reeves pulled up specifications on his tablet. "The mining operations require dedicated power generation. According to projections, we should have excess capacity available."

"According to projections, we should have a lot of things. Reality's different."

"Then we'll need to build additional solar arrays. I'll draft the requirements—"

"We're already building arrays. I designed them myself."

Reeves looked at her properly for the first time. "You're the chief engineer?"

"Alexis Kwan. And those arrays are optimized for colony survival, not mining operations."

"Corporate's priority is resource extraction. Colony support is secondary."

Alexis felt her temper flash. "Corporate's priority is profit. My priority is keeping people alive. Those aren't always compatible."

"They are when you follow proper planning procedures." Reeves pulled up schematics. "If we reallocate power distribution according to corporate's operational model—"

"We'd have brownouts in the residential domes within a week."

"Acceptable short-term sacrifice for long-term productivity."

"Not acceptable to the people living in those domes." Alexis pulled up her own models. "Look at these consumption patterns. We're already operating at ninety-five percent capacity. Your mining equipment will push us to one hundred and fifteen percent. That means choosing between life support and ore processing."

"Then we expand capacity."

"With what resources? What timeline? Corporate stopped our equipment shipments, remember?"

Reeves frowned. "They did?"

"Two months ago. Pending investigation of subsurface structures. Which you're standing on top of right now."

That got his attention. "Structures?"

Alexis pulled up Hassan's surveys. "Ancient Martian civilization. Or visitors. We're not sure yet. But extensive underground network that corporate wants exclusive access to. So they froze colony development until Earth's scientific team arrives."

Reeves studied the data. "This changes everything."

"It does for us. What does it change for you?"

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Mining operations can't proceed if we're sitting on alien technology. Corporate will want that secured first."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning I need to contact Earth. Get updated directives." Reeves closed his tablet. "Thank you for the information, Chief Engineer."

He left. Alexis stood in the bay, wondering if she'd just made things better or worse.

That evening, Reeves requested a meeting with Rivera. The entire senior staff attended.

"I've reviewed the situation," Reeves began. "The subsurface structures complicate everything corporate planned. Mining operations can't proceed until we understand the scope."

"We told them that," Rivera said.

"I know. But corporate's risk assessment team doesn't understand the reality on ground. They're making decisions based on incomplete data."

"Welcome to our world," Chen muttered.

Reeves ignored him. "I'm recommending we delay mining operations and prioritize colony stabilization. We can't extract resources if we're dead from equipment failure."

Alexis blinked. "You're supporting us?"

"I'm supporting survival." Reeves pulled up revised plans. "My team includes structural engineers, geologists, and equipment specialists. We'll help stabilize the colony infrastructure. In exchange, I need your cooperation surveying the subsurface structures."

"Why?"

"Because if there's technology down there worth extracting, corporate will pay for proper colony expansion. Everyone wins."

Rivera studied him. "You're thinking long-term."

"I'm thinking survival and profit aren't mutually exclusive. We just need better planning." Reeves met her eyes. "Work with me, Commander. Let's build something that actually lasts."

Alexis looked at Rivera, who gave a slight nod.

"Okay," Alexis said. "But colony survival takes priority. Always."

"Agreed."

They shook hands. Wary. Uncertain. But willing to try.

Because on Mars, you took allies where you found them.

Even when they arrived from corporate.

Especially then.
