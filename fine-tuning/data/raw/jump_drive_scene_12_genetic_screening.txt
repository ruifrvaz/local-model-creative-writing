Dr. Emma Torres compared neural scans from five adapted pilots and felt pattern recognition crystallize. They weren't random variations. They were evolutionary convergence.

"Look at the temporal processing structures," she told Dr. Aisha Mbara. "Sarah, Marcus, Chen, Rodriguez, Patel—all showing identical neural architecture in the hippocampus. Different baseline brain structures, but the temporal adaptations are eerily consistent."

Aisha examined the overlays. Five different brains. Five identical temporal processing centers. Like evolution finding the same solution independently.

"That's not random mutation. That's directed neuroplasticity responding to specific environmental pressure."

"The Alcubierre field is the environmental pressure. It's forcing neural adaptation toward a specific structure." Emma pulled up molecular analysis. "And look at the gene expression changes. All five pilots show upregulation of the same neuroplasticity markers. Their brains are rewriting themselves using identical genetic pathways."

"Which means the temporal adaptation is reproducible. Not chaos, but biology responding predictably to exotic physics."

"Exactly. If we can understand the pathway, we might be able to enhance it. Accelerate adaptation. Reduce the fragmentation risk."

Aisha pulled up Lieutenant Park's scans. His brain had tried to adapt but failed. Neural structures started forming then collapsed. Gene expression markers showed activation then catastrophic downregulation.

"What stopped Park from adapting?"

Emma ran comparative analysis. "Genetic factors, probably. He's missing several neuroplasticity genes that all five successful adapters possess. His brain literally couldn't restructure fast enough to accommodate temporal variance."

"So adaptation success is genetically determined?"

"Partially. Genetics loads the gun, but environmental factors pull the trigger. Park had genetic disadvantages, but he might have survived with better shielding or slower field exposure." Emma highlighted correlation factors. "We can screen for genetic markers now. Identify candidates most likely to adapt successfully."

"Admiral Kowalski will want that immediately. Reduce pilot losses. Improve success rates."

"Admiral Kowalski will want to create designer pilots. Select for neuroplasticity genes. Breed humans optimized for FTL travel."

The implications hung between them. Eugenics. Genetic selection. Engineering humanity for faster-than-light consciousness.

"That's not our decision to make," Aisha said carefully.

"But it's a decision someone will make. FTL travel is too valuable. If genetic screening improves adaptation rates, military and corporate interests will mandate it."

"Then we document the ethical concerns. Make the genetic requirements public. Let society decide whether they're willing to screen pilots based on neuroplasticity markers."

Emma pulled up the gene sequences. "I'm running this by the ethics board. But I'm also preparing the screening protocols. Because even if society debates for years, the military will want genetic testing implemented immediately."

She was right. Three days later, Admiral Kowalski ordered mandatory genetic screening for all FTL pilot candidates.

"We're not engineering super-pilots," he insisted during the briefing. "We're identifying individuals naturally suited for temporal adaptation. No different than screening astronauts for bone density or pilots for visual acuity."

"Except we're selecting for genes that allow consciousness to fragment across multiple timelines," Aisha said. "That's not physical aptitude. That's neurological transformation."

"Which is necessary for FTL operations. Would you prefer we send pilots with genetic disadvantages to certain fragmentation?"

"I'd prefer we solve the temporal effects so genetic screening becomes unnecessary."

"Work on that too. But in the meantime, we screen candidates." Kowalski pulled up the genetic markers. "How many people have the optimal combination?"

Emma consulted her database. "Approximately twelve percent of the general population carry all five key neuroplasticity genes. Among military pilots, fifteen percent."

"So we've been randomly selecting from a pool where eighty-five percent were likely to fail adaptation."

"We didn't know genetic factors were relevant until we had enough data to establish patterns."

"Now we know. Implement screening immediately. All future volunteers get genetic testing before jump operations."

The screening program began within a week. Genetic samples from four hundred pilot candidates. Analysis looking for specific markers: BDNF variants, COMT polymorphisms, neuroplasticity factors that determined whether brains could restructure under temporal stress.

The results were sobering.

Of four hundred candidates, forty-three showed optimal genetic profiles. Another eighty-one showed partial markers suggesting moderate adaptation capability. The remaining two hundred seventy-six showed genetic configurations predicting certain fragmentation failure.

"We just eliminated sixty-nine percent of our candidate pool," Aisha told Kowalski.

"We eliminated sixty-nine percent of certain casualties. The forty-three optimal candidates will form our core FTL pilot corps. The partial-marker group can serve as backup with enhanced shielding protocols."

"And the two hundred seventy-six without neuroplasticity genes?"

"They serve in conventional roles. Nobody's being punished for genetic configuration. But we're not sending people with Park's genetic profile into Alcubierre fields knowing they'll fragment."

Aisha had to admit the logic was sound. Cruel in its efficiency, but sound.

The genetic screening revealed another pattern. The forty-three optimal candidates clustered in specific demographic groups. Northern European descent showed higher neuroplasticity marker frequency. East Asian populations showed different but equally effective genetic configurations. Sub-Saharan African populations showed third-variant markers that Emma suspected might allow even faster adaptation.

"We're looking at evolutionary divergence," Emma said. "Different populations developed different neuroplasticity genes in response to different environmental pressures. Now those genes determine who can adapt to FTL travel."

"That's going to create political problems."

"Science doesn't care about politics. The genes either confer adaptation capability or they don't."

"Politicians will care that FTL pilot selection correlates with ethnicity."

"Then politicians need to understand that correlation isn't causation. These genes distribute across ethnic groups because of evolutionary history. We're not selecting based on ethnicity. We're selecting based on genetic capability."

The distinction mattered scientifically. Politically, it would be nightmare.

Aisha prepared the briefing documents. Genetic screening results. Demographic correlations. Ethical implications. She presented everything to Admiral Kowalski and waited for the explosion.

It didn't come.

"This is actually useful," Kowalski said, studying the data. "We can recruit strategically. Target populations with high neuroplasticity marker frequencies. Build FTL pilot programs in regions with optimal genetic profiles."

"That sounds like eugenics with extra steps."

"That sounds like efficient resource allocation. We need FTL-capable pilots. Genetics determines capability. We recruit where capability clusters. What's the ethical problem?"

"The historical problem of selecting humans based on genetic profiles. That's led to horrific outcomes historically."

"When selection was based on arbitrary characteristics like eye color or height. We're selecting based on functional capability directly relevant to mission success. That's different."

Was it? Aisha wasn't certain. The logic seemed sound. But logic had justified terrible things throughout history.

"I'm documenting my concerns."

"Document whatever you need. But implement the screening. We've already lost too many pilots to preventable fragmentation."

The program expanded. Genetic testing for all FTL candidates. Selective recruitment based on neuroplasticity markers. Enhanced training for optimal-profile pilots.

Within six months, the FTL program had thirty-two genetically-screened pilots in active rotation. Adaptation rates improved dramatically. Instead of thirty percent success, they achieved seventy-five percent.

The cost was philosophical discomfort about genetic selection.

The gain was three-quarters of pilots surviving temporal adaptation instead of one-third.

Aisha watched the program succeed and felt unease anyway. They were engineering humanity for FTL capability. Selecting genetic configurations that allowed consciousness fragmentation. Creating a subspecies adapted to non-linear causality.

Was that progress or transformation?

Evolution or engineering?

Sarah Chen sat in her three-meter cage and read the genetic reports. "They tested my genome. I have all five optimal markers plus two others they haven't catalogued yet."

"Does that change how you feel about your adaptation?"

"It means I was genetically predisposed to survive temporal fragmentation. My volunteering wasn't random chance. My genes made adaptation possible." Sarah pulled up her family history. "My grandfather showed signs of unusual temporal perception. He'd predict events days in advance. Family thought he was psychic. Probably just early neuroplasticity gene expression."

"You inherited genetic capability for temporal omniscience."

"And I fulfilled that genetic potential by jumping through Alcubierre fields until my brain restructured." Sarah smiled across multiple timeframes. "Feels less like heroism and more like genetic destiny."

"Does that diminish your choice?"

"No. My genes gave me capability. I chose to use it. Both matter."

Aisha left the meeting thinking about capability versus choice. Genetics versus agency. The intersection where biology met decision.

They were screening pilots for genes that allowed temporal consciousness. Creating a genetic elite capable of FTL operations. Dividing humanity into those who could fragment across timelines and those who couldn't.

The future implications were staggering.

But the immediate mission was clear: Get humanity to the stars. By any means necessary. With any capable pilots willing to volunteer.

Even if capability was genetically determined from birth.

Even if volunteering meant fulfilling genetic destiny instead of making free choice.

Progress demanded sacrifice.

Genetics just determined who could afford to pay.
