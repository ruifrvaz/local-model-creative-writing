Chen Liu lay under the Salvage Rights' main power coupling and considered the mathematics of failure.

The coupling was rated for ten thousand hours of operation. They'd logged forty-three thousand. It should have failed catastrophically years ago.

But Chen had kept it alive through improvisation, prayer, and what his grandfather called "mechanical spite."

"How's it looking?" Kayla's voice through the comm.

"Like a disaster that hasn't decided to happen yet."

"Can you fix it?"

"I can delay it."

Chen pulled another shim from his tool kit. Hand-fabricated from scrap metal, precisely calibrated to compensate for worn-out components. He slid it into place and felt the coupling pressure stabilize.

Temporarily.

The ship hummed around him. Every sound was a conversation if you knew how to listen. The high-pitched whine of the oxygen recycler meant filters needed cleaning. The bass vibration in the deck plates meant the fusion reactor was running slightly off-balance.

Chen knew this ship better than he knew people. Every bolt. Every wire. Every system that kept four humans alive in the void.

And every one was failing faster than he could repair.

He crawled out from under the coupling and pulled up his maintenance log. Seventeen critical systems. All running past their design life. All held together through improvisation that would horrify a proper engineer.

But Chen wasn't a proper engineer. He was a belt mechanic. He made things work with whatever was available.

Captain Torres found him in the engine room, surrounded by disassembled parts.

"What's the prognosis?" Jax asked.

"We need a real shipyard. Proper parts. Time to do this right."

"We have none of those things."

"I know." Chen gestured at the parts spread across the deck. "So I'm jury-rigging a solution that'll buy us maybe six months. After that, we're looking at cascading failures."

Jax sat on a storage crate. Thirty years of mining showed in his face—lines carved by hard vacuum and harder choices.

"The consortium wants us to stay on station. Keep the claim protected."

"The ship wants us to dock somewhere civilized before critical systems start failing."

"Can't do both."

"No. You can't."

They sat in the engine room's mechanical symphony. The ship talking to people who understood its language.

"What would you do?" Jax asked. "If it was your call?"

Chen thought about it honestly. "Depends on what matters more. The claim or the ship."

"The claim is worth millions. The ship is replaceable."

"The ship kept us alive for fifteen years. You can't replace that in credits."

Jax pulled up the consortium logistics. "They're offering to send technical support. Spare parts. Help us maintain position."

"When?"

"Three weeks."

"We might make three weeks." Chen highlighted the critical failure points. "Might. But I wouldn't bet the crew on it."

"What if we rotated out? Left someone here with a skeleton crew while the rest went for repairs?"

"You mean leave the claim vulnerable?"

"I mean keep everyone alive while we figure out the logistics."

Chen ran the numbers. A skeleton crew could maintain the claim with minimal ship functions. The full crew could take the ship to a repair station. Return in six weeks with proper parts and full capability.

"It could work," Chen said. "If the skeleton crew doesn't face trouble. If corporate doesn't push during the repair window. If nothing critical fails while we're separated."

"Too many ifs."

"Everything out here is ifs."

Jax stood. "I'll talk to Keiko. See if the consortium can provide security for a skeleton crew."

After he left, Chen returned to the power coupling. The shim was holding. For now.

He thought about his daughter on Mars. About the money he sent every month so she could attend proper schools. About the reason he'd spent fifteen years in the belt instead of watching her grow up.

The Salvage Rights wasn't just a ship. It was fifteen years of sacrifice. Of choosing credits over family. Of believing that one big score would make it all worthwhile.

And they'd found it. The blue glowing mineral that could change everything.

They just had to survive long enough to claim it.

Chen pulled his toolkit close and started fabricating another shim. Then another. Building redundancy into systems that had no margin for error.

The ship hummed its mechanical conversation. Chen listened. Diagnosed. Planned his next intervention.

This was what he did. Keep things running past their design life. Make the impossible sustainable. Buy time with ingenuity and spite.

He'd kept the Salvage Rights alive for fifteen years.

He'd keep it alive for however long they needed.

Because giving up meant those fifteen years were wasted. Meant his daughter's sacrifice—growing up without her father—was for nothing.

Chen wouldn't accept that.

So he'd keep fixing. Keep improvising. Keep the ship talking instead of screaming.

That's what mechanics did in the belt.

They made miracles from scrap metal and hope.

And hoped it was enough.
