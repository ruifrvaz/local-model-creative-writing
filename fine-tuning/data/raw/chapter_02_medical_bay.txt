The medical bay's sterile lighting hurt her eyes. Elena sat on the examination table while Dr. Chen ran diagnostics on her arm.

"The integration's holding," Chen said, studying the holographic readout. "But the neural load is increasing. You're pushing too hard."

Elena flexed her fingers. Metal whispered against synthetic muscle. "I need the responsiveness."

"What you need is to let the tissue adapt." Chen tapped a sequence into his tablet. "The implant was designed for gradual integration, not combat deployment three weeks post-surgery."

"We didn't have three weeks." Elena watched the data scroll past. Nerve conductivity, response latency, muscle memory patterns. All within acceptable parameters. Barely.

Chen leaned against the counter, arms crossed. "I saw your request for the combat package upgrade."

"Denied, I assume."

"By me, actually. The board would've approved it." He pulled up another screen. "Your neural pathways are still forming. Adding aggressive subroutines now would risk permanent damage."

Elena studied her reflection in the polished steel cabinet. Half her face was still bruised from the explosion. The arm had saved her life. It just hadn't saved anyone else.

"How long?" she asked.

"Six months. Maybe eight."

"I don't have eight months."

"Then you'll make do with what you have." Chen closed the display. "The arm responds to your intent. Train the intent, Captain. The technology will follow."

She slid off the table. The arm moved like it was born to her—smooth, precise, deadly. Sometimes she forgot it wasn't real. Sometimes she wished she could.

The medical bay's secondary display showed crew vital signs. Ninety-six names, ninety-six heartbeats. Elena scanned the list out of habit. Everyone stable. Everyone alive.

Unlike Phobos, where three hundred names had gone dark in the span of ninety seconds.

"The diagnostic results from last week," Elena said. "You found something."

Chen hesitated. "Your cortisol levels are elevated. Sleep patterns are disrupted. I'm seeing markers consistent with acute stress disorder."

"Diagnosis: command of a deep space vessel in hostile territory. Prognosis: unavoidable."

"Elena—"

"We're three months from the nearest support. Fleet sent us here to investigate quantum anomalies that killed three hundred people. Stress is appropriate."

Chen pulled a small device from his pocket. "This is a neural regulator. It would help with the nightmares."

"It would also dull my edge. I can't afford that."

"You can't afford to break down."

Elena looked at the device. Sleek, medical-white, promising. A chemical solution to a problem that wasn't chemical. Katie's face floated in her memory—smiling, always smiling, right up until the end.

"I'll think about it," she lied.

Chen knew it was a lie. He pocketed the regulator anyway. "The crew looks to you for stability. If you fracture, they fracture."

"I'm not going to fracture."

"Katie said the same thing."

The words hit like a physical blow. Elena's cybernetic hand clenched, servos whining softly. Chen didn't flinch.

"That was out of line," she said quietly.

"It was necessary." Chen's expression softened. "Your sister was brilliant. Fearless. She pushed herself past every limit because she thought she had to prove something. And it killed her."

"The anomaly killed her."

"The anomaly pulled the trigger. But she loaded the gun herself." Chen moved closer. "You're doing the same thing. Pushing the implants. Skipping sleep. Taking command decisions that should involve the senior staff. You're trying to carry Phobos alone."

"Someone has to."

"No. Someone has to let it go."

Elena turned toward the door. "Thanks for the checkup, Doc."

"Elena." Chen's voice stopped her. "The arm is working perfectly. It's the rest of you I'm worried about."

She left without answering. The corridor stretched ahead, metal and shadows. Through the viewport, distant stars burned cold and indifferent.

The nightmares would come tonight. They always did.

But she'd survive them the way she'd survived Phobos—alone, awake, and ready for whatever came next.
