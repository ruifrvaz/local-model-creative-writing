The medical bay's sterile lighting hurt her eyes. Elena sat on the examination table while Dr. Chen ran diagnostics on her arm.

"The integration's holding," Chen said, studying the holographic readout. "But the neural load is increasing. You're pushing too hard."

Elena flexed her fingers. Metal whispered against synthetic muscle. "I need the responsiveness."

"What you need is to let the tissue adapt." Chen tapped a sequence into his tablet. "The implant was designed for gradual integration, not combat deployment three weeks post-surgery."

"We didn't have three weeks." Elena watched the data scroll past. Nerve conductivity, response latency, muscle memory patterns. All within acceptable parameters. Barely.

Chen leaned against the counter, arms crossed. "I saw your request for the combat package upgrade."

"Denied, I assume."

"By me, actually. The board would've approved it." He pulled up another screen. "Your neural pathways are still forming. Adding aggressive subroutines now would risk permanent damage."

Elena studied her reflection in the polished steel cabinet. Half her face was still bruised from the explosion. The arm had saved her life. It just hadn't saved anyone else.

"How long?" she asked.

"Six months. Maybe eight."

"I don't have eight months."

"Then you'll make do with what you have." Chen closed the display. "The arm responds to your intent. Train the intent, Captain. The technology will follow."

She slid off the table. The arm moved like it was born to her—smooth, precise, deadly. Sometimes she forgot it wasn't real. Sometimes she wished she could.

"Thanks, Doc."

"Elena." He caught her at the door. "The nightmares. Are they getting worse?"

She didn't answer. The door hissed shut behind her.
