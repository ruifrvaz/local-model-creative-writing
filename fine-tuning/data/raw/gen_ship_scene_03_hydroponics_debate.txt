The hydroponics bay stretched three levels, green and humid and alive. James Okoye moved between the crop rows, scanning leaves for disease markers. This was where he came when the medical data became too heavy to carry alone.

A rustle behind him. Malik Torres emerged from the tomato section, dirt on his hands.

"Didn't expect to find you here, Doctor."

"I volunteer when I need to think." James examined a leaf, noted slight yellowing. Nitrogen deficiency. "You?"

"Same. Plus the hydroponics crew needs help. We're down two people since the council announcement."

James understood. The crew referendum had fractured normal operations. People were taking sides, having arguments, skipping shifts to attend endless debate sessions. The ship still functioned, but the social cohesion that made it work was fraying.

"You've seen the genetic reports." Malik wasn't asking.

"I wrote them. Well, compiled them. The data comes from the medical monitoring system." James pulled up his tablet, showed the projections. "We're tracking a dozen markers that indicate declining diversity. Rare recessive disorders showing up more frequently. Decreased fertility rates. Immune system weaknesses."

"How long before it's critical?"

"Depends on your definition of critical. We're already seeing impacts. Every generation it gets worse." James moved to the next row. "The original planners knew this was a risk. They thought the cryo banks would give us enough genetic material to manage it."

"Until the radiation event destroyed most of them."

"Yeah. That wasn't in the mission specifications."

They worked in silence for a while, pruning plants, checking water levels, doing the routine maintenance that kept three thousand people fed. The hydroponics bay was the ship's literal life support. If these systems failed, everything else became irrelevant.

"I keep thinking about responsibility," Malik said finally. "The people who launched this mission—they're dead. They don't face the consequences of their decisions. We do. Our children do. Their children do."

"That's how generational missions work."

"Doesn't make it fair."

James pruned a diseased branch, dropped it in the disposal. "Fair isn't a category that applies in deep space. There's functional and non-functional. Survivable and non-survivable. Fair is something we left behind with Earth."

"You really believe that?"

"I have to. Otherwise the medical decisions I make would be impossible." James pulled up his patient roster. "I have a twelve-year-old girl with a genetic disorder that's appearing in the population because of diversity loss. I can treat her symptoms, keep her comfortable, but I can't fix the underlying problem. That problem is generational."

Malik stopped working. "The council needs to know this."

"The council does know. I presented the full data. They're just not sure what to do with it."

"We divert to HD 85512. We shorten the timeline. We give that girl and kids like her a chance to have healthy children of their own."

"Or we die trying to settle a marginal world that might not support human life long-term."

Malik's expression hardened. "You've seen the data. You know the genetic projections. How can you not support diversion?"

"Because I've also seen what happens when populations make decisions based on fear instead of analysis." James moved to the monitoring station, pulled up the crop yields. "These plants are genetically modified for ship growth. Optimized for artificial light, limited soil, recycled water. If we settle HD 85512, we need to establish agriculture in alien conditions with Earth-normal crop genetics."

"We have seed banks."

"We have limited seed banks with limited variety. And no experience growing food in alien soil with alien biochemistry and unknown environmental factors."

"So we stay on the ship and hope the genetic diversity holds out?"

"I'm saying both options carry massive risks. The diversion advocates act like HD 85512 is a guaranteed solution. It's not. It's a gamble with different odds."

Malik pulled weeds aggressively. "At least it's a gamble we can take within one or two generations. Continuing to Tau Ceti means gambling that the ship holds together for two more centuries."

"While settling HD 85512 means gambling that we can establish viable agriculture, industry, and civilization on a world we know almost nothing about."

They worked in tense silence. James understood Malik's frustration. The engineering data was clear—the ship was degrading. But medical data was equally clear about the challenges of establishing human populations in novel environments.

"I saw your structural analysis," James said quietly. "The microfracture propagation in the main hull. That's concerning."

"It's catastrophic if it continues. We need to either reinforce the hull or reduce the duration we're asking it to maintain integrity."

"And your proposal to cannibalize the aft sections—you understand what that means medically?"

Malik stopped working. "Controlled population reduction. I know. I'm not advocating for forced sterilization or killing people. I'm talking about resource consolidation and voluntary family planning."

"Voluntary family planning that's coerced by survival necessity. That's not really voluntary."

"Better than dying because we couldn't face hard choices."

James pulled up a different data set. "I've been modeling what settlement would look like. Best case scenario, we land on HD 85512 with current population. Establish basic infrastructure in year one. Expand agriculture in years two through five. Achieve self-sufficiency by year ten."

"That's optimistic."

"Very. Realistic scenario involves twenty to thirty percent mortality in the first five years. Disease, accidents, environmental factors we didn't anticipate. We'd need to maintain high birth rates to compensate, which creates its own genetic diversity pressures."

Malik absorbed this. "You're saying the settlement option doesn't actually solve the diversity problem?"

"I'm saying it changes the timeline but doesn't eliminate the underlying issue. We need either a larger population base or access to genetic material we don't currently have."

"So we're fucked either way."

James pruned another branch. "We're challenged either way. There's a difference."

"Explain it to that twelve-year-old girl with the genetic disorder."

The words hit hard. James set down his pruning shears. "Her name is Amara. She's funny, brilliant, wants to be an astrophysicist. I've known her since she was born. I diagnosed her condition when she was six."

"And?"

"And I'll do everything I can to give her a healthy life. But I won't make civilizational decisions based solely on individual cases, no matter how much I care about them." James met Malik's eyes. "That's the burden of my position. I have to think about population-level outcomes, not just individual patients."

"Sounds convenient. Lets you avoid the emotional weight."

"It doesn't let me avoid anything. I carry every patient I can't fully help. But if I make decisions emotionally instead of analytically, more people suffer."

Malik pulled up his own tablet, showed the hull stress projections. "This is analytical. Pure physics and materials science. The ship is failing. We need to either reinforce it or reduce the timeline. Emotion doesn't factor into structural engineering."

"Except when you're deciding which sections to cannibalize. Which families to displace. Which cultural spaces to sacrifice. That's all emotion and politics disguised as engineering."

They stared at each other across the tomato plants. Two professionals, both certain they were right, both carrying impossible responsibilities.

"The vote is in two weeks," Malik said finally. "How are you voting?"

James considered. "I'm voting for full transparency. I want the entire crew to see all the data—medical, engineering, agricultural, social. Then I want them to choose based on complete information."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer I have. I'm a doctor, not a prophet. I can model scenarios, but I can't predict which choice leads to survival. So I'm trusting the collective wisdom of three thousand people to make a better decision than any individual expert."

"That's a lot of faith in democracy."

"It's the only fair option. The mission affects everyone. Everyone should have input."

Malik nodded slowly. "All right. Full data. Full transparency. Then we let the crew choose."

"And we live with the consequences."

"Or die with them."

James returned to his pruning. The plants grew, green and vital, sustained by careful systems designed by people who'd never live to see the harvest.

Kind of like the mission itself.

"For what it's worth," Malik said, "I respect what you're trying to do. The medical advocacy for the crew's health. It's important work."

"Same. Your engineering analysis is solid. We need that rigor to make informed choices."

"Even if we end up on opposite sides of the vote?"

"Even then. Especially then. Democracy works when people can disagree respectfully and still function together."

Malik smiled slightly. "My grandmother used to say that. She was second-generation council."

"Mine too. They served together." James pulled a photo from his tablet. Two women, middle-aged, standing in this same hydroponics bay. "They maintained the ship when things got hard. We owe them the same dedication."

"Then let's make sure the vote is fair, transparent, and honors everyone's voice."

"Agreed."

They worked together in the green quiet, tending the plants that kept them all alive.

Just like their grandmothers had.

Just like their grandchildren would.

If any of them survived long enough to have grandchildren.
