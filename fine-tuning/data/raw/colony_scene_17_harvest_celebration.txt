Yuki stood in the expanded hydroponics bay, surrounded by life. Fifty percent more growing space than six months ago. New crop varieties. Increased yield.

They'd done it. Achieved food security on Mars.

She walked between the beds, checking leaf health and soil conditions. The tomatoes were heavy with fruit. The lettuce grew in thick clusters. The wheat waved gently in the circulated air.

Beautiful. Sufficient. Sustainable.

Martinez joined her, carrying a water quality report. "Everything's optimal. The new filtration system is working better than projected."

"Good." Yuki picked a ripe tomato and bit into it. The flavor exploded across her tongue—sweet, acidic, perfectly balanced.

Food grown on Mars. From Martian soil and recycled water and human ingenuity.

She'd never tasted anything better.

"We're celebrating tonight," she said. "Full harvest feast. Real food, no rations, no limits."

"Rivera approved that?"

"Rivera suggested it. After everything we've been through, the colony deserves a night of abundance."

Martinez smiled. "I'll help with preparations."

They spent the afternoon harvesting. Tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, strawberries. More food than they could eat in one meal, but that was the point.

Abundance. Proof that Mars could sustain human life without Earth's support.

The common area filled with colonists at dinner time. Someone had constructed a long table from salvaged materials. Others brought dishes and utensils. The mood was festive, almost giddy.

Rivera stood and raised her glass—water, but served in celebration. "Six months ago, corporate told us to abandon this colony. Said Mars couldn't support permanent human habitation."

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd.

"They were wrong. You proved them wrong. Every one of you." Rivera gestured at the food. "This harvest represents our independence. Our future. Our home."

Cheers erupted. Someone started clapping, and soon everyone joined in.

Yuki felt tears prick her eyes. They'd done it. Built something permanent on a world that didn't want them.

The meal was chaos and joy. People traded plates, shared recipes they'd improvised with Martian ingredients, laughed at jokes that probably weren't that funny but felt perfect in the moment.

Hassan sat beside Elena Reeves, now four months old and thriving. The baby watched the celebration with wide eyes, unaware that this world was supposed to be impossible.

"She's doing well," Yuki observed.

"Better than well. Her development is ahead of Earth standards in some areas. The reduced gravity seems beneficial for infant motor control." Hassan smiled at Elena, who grabbed his finger. "She's our proof of concept. Mars's first native, healthy and strong."

"How many pregnancies now?"

"Five confirmed, three more suspected. Mars's population is growing."

Yuki thought about that. Children born here. Growing up Martian. Never knowing Earth's heavy gravity or easy air.

A new branch of humanity, adapted to a different world.

Alexis approached with a plate of food. "This is incredible, Tanaka. You've outdone yourself."

"We've outdone ourselves. All of us." Yuki gestured at the colony. "Six months from corporate abandonment to food security. That's not individual achievement. That's collective survival."

"Sounds like you're writing the history books already."

"Someone should. Future generations need to know how Mars was really built. Not the corporate mythology. The truth."

Chen raised his glass. "To truth, then. And to stubborn people who refuse to quit."

"To Mars," someone called.

"To home," another voice added.

The celebration continued late into the night. Eventually, people drifted away in small groups, heading for quarters with full stomachs and light hearts.

Yuki stayed in the common area, cleaning up. Martinez helped, the two of them working in comfortable silence.

"You miss Earth?" he asked eventually.

Yuki thought about her family. Her old life. Everything she'd left behind.

"Sometimes. But this—" she gestured at the empty plates, the evidence of abundance. "This matters more. We're building something Earth can't imagine. A second home for humanity."

"You think others will come? Once word spreads that we've succeeded?"

"Eventually. When Earth gets crowded enough or desperate enough. Mars will be here, ready."

Martinez stacked plates. "My daughter—back on Earth—she's eight now. Growing up in overcrowded cities, breathing recycled smog. I want her to see this. Clean air, open space, room to grow."

"Bring her. We'll make room."

"Maybe. When Mars is safer. More stable."

"Mars will never be safe. But it can be home anyway."

They finished cleaning and parted ways. Yuki returned to the hydroponics bay, checking systems one final time before sleep.

The plants grew silently, transforming Martian resources into food. Elegant. Efficient. Sustainable.

She'd come to Mars as a life support specialist. Become a farmer instead. Learned to coax life from barren soil and hostile conditions.

Worth it. All of it.

The sacrifices. The loneliness. The constant threat of failure.

Worth it to stand in this bay and see food growing where nothing should live.

Yuki closed her eyes and felt the bay around her. Warm. Humid. Alive.

Mars wasn't dead. Not anymore.

Humans had brought life here. And life, once established, was remarkably stubborn about surviving.

She smiled and headed for her quarters. Tomorrow would bring new challenges. Equipment failures. Resource constraints. The endless demands of keeping humans alive on a hostile world.

But tonight, they'd celebrated. Abundance on Mars. Impossible made routine.

That was enough. More than enough.

Yuki slept well for the first time in months, dreaming of green things growing in red soil.

Mars dreams. Home dreams.

The only kind that mattered now.
