The corporate ship appeared on sensors three days after they'd hidden the samples.

Captain Jax Torres watched it approach, his jaw tight. "They found us."

"Impossible," Kayla Okonkwo said from the pilot's station. "We've been running silent. Random trajectory. No pattern."

"And yet there they are." Jax pulled up the tactical display. "Military-grade drive. Corporate registry. Armed."

Wrench appeared from the engine room. "We can outrun them if we burn hard. Push the reactor to redline."

"For how long?" Sofia Ruiz asked.

"Three days. Maybe four. Then we need to cool down or the reactor melts." Wrench checked his readouts. "But it'll put distance between us."

Jax calculated. Three days of hard burn, then they'd be vulnerable. The corporate ship would still be chasing.

"We need a different strategy. Something they won't expect."

"Such as?" Kayla asked.

Jax studied the asteroid field map. "We make them think we're running, then double back. Hide in plain sight while they chase ghosts."

"That's insane," Sofia said.

"That's why it might work." Jax pulled up a nearby asteroid cluster. "We burn hard for six hours, get their attention, make them commit to pursuit. Then we kill our drive, go dark, and coast into that cluster. Let momentum carry us."

"They'll track our trajectory," Kayla pointed out.

"Initially. But if we adjust vector at the last second, they'll overshoot." Jax highlighted the maneuver. "It's risky, but it might buy us time."

Wrench grinned. "I love terrible plans. They're the only ones that work."

Jax activated ship-wide comm. "Everyone, strap in. We're about to do something stupid."

The burn was violent. Full reactor output, maximum thrust, the ship shaking as it accelerated beyond design tolerances. Alarms screamed about thermal stress and structural limits.

The corporate ship matched their acceleration. Gaining slowly but steadily.

"They're faster," Kayla reported. "We can't outrun them long-term."

"Don't need to. Just need to commit them." Jax watched the distance shrink. "Six hours. Hold course."

Those six hours felt like forever. The ship creaking, the reactor running hot, the corporate vessel closing the gap. Every kilometer bought with stress on their already-taxed systems.

"Now," Jax said. "Kill the drive. Go dark."

Kayla cut the reactor. Silence flooded the ship as the thrusters died. They were coasting now, momentum carrying them forward.

"Adjust vector. Five degrees starboard, three degrees down."

Kayla fired maneuvering thrusters. Tiny bursts, barely noticeable on sensors. The ship's trajectory shifted slightly.

"All systems offline. No emissions. We're a rock now."

The corporate ship continued past their position, still chasing the ghost of their original trajectory. It would take them hours to realize their target had vanished.

"Into the cluster," Jax ordered.

They drifted into the asteroid field, a silent ghost among hundreds of tumbling rocks. Kayla used minimal maneuvering thrust to avoid collisions, keeping them invisible.

"Now we wait," Jax said. "Silent running until they give up or we figure out our next move."

The waiting was worse than the chase. Hours in darkness, minimal life support, no active sensors. Just passive listening and hoping they weren't detected.

Sofia broke the silence. "They knew where to find us. How?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Jax pulled up their route history. "We've been careful. No communications, no beacons, random trajectory."

"Unless we're broadcasting something we don't know about," Wrench suggested. "Tracker hidden in the ship, maybe. Maintenance equipment corporate installed."

Jax felt cold. "Can you sweep for that?"

"If we power up systems. But that means going active. They'll see us."

"Then we do it quick. Thirty-second burst, full spectrum scan, then dark again."

Wrench pulled up the scanning protocols. "Ready when you are."

"Do it."

The ship's systems flickered to life. Sensors active, sweeping their own hull and internal spaces. Thirty seconds felt like an eternity.

Then darkness again.

"Got something," Wrench reported. "Transponder beacon embedded in the ore processing equipment. Corporate standard installation. I never thought to check it."

"Can you disable it?"

"If we power up, yeah. But it's already been broadcasting our position."

Jax cursed. "Then they know exactly where we are. This cluster, this position. We didn't lose them at all."

"What do we do?" Sofia asked.

"We accept that hiding isn't working." Jax pulled up the communication array. "And we change the game. Kayla, power us up. Wrench, kill that transponder. Sofia, get your samples ready."

"Ready for what?"

"For leverage." Jax started composing a message. "We can't outrun them. We can't hide. So we negotiate."

The message was simple. Directed at the corporate ship, unencrypted, completely open.

"We have samples of unprecedented scientific value. We're willing to discuss terms for their transfer. No violence necessary. Let's talk like civilized people."

The response came within an hour.

"This is Corporate Security Vessel Athena. You are in possession of proprietary discovery on a corporate-claimed asteroid. Surrender samples and stand by for boarding."

Jax replied: "The asteroid is unclaimed. Our extraction was legal. The samples are ours. We're willing to sell, but not surrender."

Another hour. Then: "What are your terms?"

Jax pulled up his calculations. "Fair market value for unique scientific materials. Independent arbitration. Public disclosure of the discovery. Non-exclusive rights."

"That's not how corporate operates," Sofia said.

"Which is why they're going to hate it." Jax sent the terms. "But it makes them choose. Negotiate fairly or take by force. Either way, we've made this public."

The corporate response was immediate and angry. "You don't have the authority to make these demands. Stand down."

"We have the samples. That's all the authority we need." Jax pulled up his insurance message—the one he'd sent to journalists and scientific institutions. "And we have insurance. If anything happens to us, the data goes public anyway."

Silence. Long silence. Corporate calculating their options.

Finally: "We're willing to discuss terms. But not with independent arbiters. This is a corporate matter."

"Then we have nothing to discuss." Jax killed the comm. "They're stalling. Trying to get close enough to take us by force."

"So what's our actual plan?" Wrench asked.

"We run again. But smarter this time. No transponders, no corporate equipment. We strip this ship to essentials and ghost properly."

"Where do we run to?"

"Independent station. Neutral territory where corporate can't just take what they want." Jax pulled up the belt map. "There. Freeport Station. No corporate charter, no government oversight. Just miners and prospectors."

"Three weeks away," Kayla calculated. "Can we make it?"

"We have to." Jax pulled up the power systems. "Wrench, give me everything that can run. No safety margins. Kayla, plot us a route through the densest part of the field. Make us impossible to follow."

"Jax, if they catch us—" Sofia started.

"They won't." Jax activated the reactor. "Because we're not valuable to them dead. And we've made sure killing us means losing everything."

The ship powered up. Wrench disabled every piece of corporate equipment, every potential tracker. They stripped down to independent systems only.

Kayla plotted a route that would terrify a sane pilot. Dense navigation, tight margins, constant course corrections.

"Ready?" Jax asked.

"No," Kayla said. "But let's do it anyway."

They burned out of the cluster at full thrust. The corporate ship responded immediately, accelerating in pursuit.

But Kayla's route was insane. Threading between asteroids with meters of clearance. Using gravitational assists from tumbling rocks. Making impossible maneuvers that corporate's military-grade ship couldn't match without risking hull damage.

The gap widened. Slowly. Expensively. But widening.

"They're falling back," Kayla reported. "Not willing to risk the navigation."

"Keep pushing. Get us clear of the field, then burn for Freeport."

They emerged from the asteroid cluster twelve hours later. Battered, exhausted, but free.

The corporate ship had lost them in the maze of rock.

"Set course for Freeport," Jax ordered. "Maximum sustainable burn. We don't stop until we're in neutral territory."

Three weeks. Three weeks of constant vigilance, careful resource management, and hoping corporate didn't find them again.

When Freeport Station finally appeared on sensors, Jax allowed himself to breathe.

"Welcome to independence," he said.

They docked. Transferred the samples to secure storage. Made contact with scientific institutions and independent arbiters.

The samples would be studied. The discovery would be published. And whatever happened next, corporate couldn't just take it.

They'd won. Not completely. Not permanently.

But for now, they were free.

And that was enough.
