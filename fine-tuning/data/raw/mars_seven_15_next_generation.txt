The message from Earth arrived during breakfast. Personal frequency, high-priority flag. Alexis almost ignored it.

Then she saw who it was from.

Her daughter.

Alexis sealed herself in her quarters and opened the transmission. The video loaded, and there was Emma—eighteen now, dressed in a graduation gown, standing in their backyard on Earth.

"Hi Mom. I wanted you to see this before the ceremony. I know you're watching from Mars, and I know you wish you could be here in person. But I need you to know something."

Emma's voice wavered slightly. She was nervous.

"When I was little, I was angry at you for leaving. I didn't understand why you'd go so far away. Why you'd miss birthdays and holidays and all the normal mom stuff. But I understand now. You're not up there because you don't love me. You're up there because you're helping build humanity's future. And that's important. Maybe more important than one person's birthday parties."

Alexis felt tears start. She tried to stop them, failed.

"I applied to the Mars Engineering Academy. I got in. Full scholarship." Emma smiled through her own tears. "I'm coming up there, Mom. Not right away—I have four years of training first. But after that, I want to work on the colony. Help build what you started. Because someone has to keep an eye on you and make sure you're not working yourself to death."

The video ended.

Alexis sat in stunned silence. Emma. Her daughter. Coming to Mars.

She replayed the message three times, memorizing every word, every expression, every moment.

Then she composed a response.

"Emma. I'm so proud of you. Not just for getting into the Academy—though that's amazing—but for understanding. For seeing past the absences and the distance to what I'm trying to accomplish here. You're right. I wish I could be there for every moment. But I can't. And knowing that you understand why makes it bearable.

Four years seems like forever. But it'll pass faster than you think. Study hard. Learn everything you can. Mars is unforgiving, and I need you to be ready. I need you to be safe.

I love you. I'm watching your graduation. And I'll be here when you arrive. We'll build the future together.

Mom."

She sent it and sat back. Four years. Her daughter would be twenty-two. An adult. An engineer.

A colleague.

The thought was terrifying and wonderful in equal measure.

Alexis pulled herself together and headed for the mess hall. The graduation ceremony was in three hours—enough time to grab food and make sure the video link Sofia had set up was working.

She found Hassan at a table, reviewing geological surveys.

"You look happy," he said. "What happened?"

"My daughter got into the Mars Engineering Academy."

Hassan's eyes widened. "That's incredible. Congratulations."

"Thanks. She'll be here in four years." Alexis sat down. "Which means I have four years to make sure this place is safe enough for her."

"It's Mars. 'Safe' is relative."

"Then I'll make it as safe as possible." Alexis pulled up her project list. "Starting with finishing the habitat expansion and upgrading the emergency systems."

"Your daughter would be proud."

"My daughter is going to critique every engineering decision I've made and find seventeen ways to improve them. She's brilliant and stubborn and completely unimpressed by authority."

"So, exactly like her mother." Hassan grinned. "Mars won't know what hit it."

The ceremony link activated at 1400 Mars time. Alexis watched from the lab, surrounded by monitors showing Earth feeds.

There was Emma, walking across the stage to accept her diploma. The camera was distant, the resolution not perfect, but Alexis could see her daughter's smile.

Sofia had arranged for two-way audio. Alexis heard her name called—"Emma Kwan"—heard the applause, heard Emma's friends cheering.

And then Emma turned toward the camera—toward Mars—and waved.

Alexis waved back, knowing Emma couldn't see her, not caring.

Her daughter had graduated. Had chosen Mars. Had chosen to follow the path Alexis had started.

The ceremony ended. The feed disconnected. Alexis sat in the quiet of the lab and let herself cry properly.

Pride. Relief. Joy. Fear for what Emma was choosing. Pride again because Emma was brave enough to choose it.

"Chief?"

Yuki appeared in the doorway. "I heard about Emma. Congratulations."

"Thank you."

"There's something you should see." Yuki pulled up a file. "I've been working on crew psychological profiles. Measuring stress, satisfaction, long-term viability for Mars life. And I found something interesting."

She showed Alexis the data. Crew members with family connections to Mars—either relatives already here or planning to come—showed significantly higher resilience and lower stress.

"It's hope," Yuki said. "Concrete, specific hope. Not just 'maybe I'll go home someday' but 'someone I love is coming here.' It changes the psychology of isolation."

"You think we should encourage more family connections?"

"I think we should recognize that Mars isn't just a job posting. It's becoming home for some people. And homes need families." Yuki pulled up demographic projections. "In ten years, we'll have second-generation colonists. Kids born on Mars, growing up here. We need to start planning for that reality."

Alexis hadn't thought about it. About Mars not just as a colony but as a civilization. A place where people built lives, raised families, created futures.

A place where her daughter would live and work.

"What do we need?" Alexis asked.

"Better living spaces. Educational facilities. Recreation areas that don't get converted to algae tanks." Yuki smiled. "Quality of life improvements that make this feel less like a survival mission and more like a community."

"That's a big shift."

"It's a necessary one. We've proven we can survive on Mars. Now we need to prove we can thrive."

Alexis thought about Emma. About four years from now, watching her daughter step off a shuttle onto Martian soil.

What did she want that Mars to look like?

Not just functional. Not just safe. But livable. A place where Emma could build a life worth living.

"I'll talk to Rivera," Alexis said. "See what we can do."

"She'll approve it. This aligns with her vision for the colony." Yuki stood to leave. "And Alexis? Your daughter is lucky. She's going to have an incredible role model."

After Yuki left, Alexis pulled up the colony development plans and began making notes. Improvements. Expansions. Quality-of-life projects that would transform this outpost into something more.

Into home.

Emma was coming. And Alexis intended to make sure Mars was ready for her.

Four years to build something worth inheriting.

Four years to prove that humanity could make a future here.

Four years to show her daughter that the sacrifice had been worth it.

Alexis got to work.

Outside her window, Mars turned beneath an alien sky. Red dust and ancient rocks and secrets waiting to be discovered.

But also: potential. Hope. A future where her daughter would stand on this soil and help build something extraordinary.

That future was worth fighting for.

Worth every long night and impossible crisis and moment of doubt.

Alexis pulled up the engineering specifications for a new recreation facility. Not for algae production. For people. For community. For the Mars that Emma would help build.

The work was just beginning.

But for the first time in years, Alexis felt like she was working toward something instead of just fighting to survive.

That made all the difference.

She drafted the proposal and sent it to Rivera.

Then she opened Emma's message one more time and watched her daughter smile.

Four years.

Mars would be ready.

And so would she.
