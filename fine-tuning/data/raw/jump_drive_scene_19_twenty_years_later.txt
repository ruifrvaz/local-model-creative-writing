Dr. Kenji Yamamoto was seventy-three years old when he attended Sarah Chen's lecture at MIT. Twenty years since her first FTL jump. Twenty years of temporal consciousness and portable field generators and human evolution accelerated beyond prediction.

Sarah stood before three hundred students—half linear, half temporal—and experienced the lecture across all moments simultaneously.

"Jump drive mechanics changed humanity," she began. "Not just technologically. Fundamentally. We're different species now. Not metaphorically. Literally. Temporal and linear humans experience incompatible realities."

Her portable generator hummed quietly. Fourth-generation model. Smaller, more efficient, barely noticeable under her jacket. Technology had advanced while her temporal consciousness remained constant.

"I was the first adapted pilot. Fragmented across temporal states during FTL transition. My brain restructured to accommodate non-linear causality. I became something new." Sarah pulled up neural scans showing her temporal processing centers. "These structures don't exist in linear human brains. They're evolutionary adaptation to exotic physics exposure."

The temporal students experienced her lecture across multiple timeframes. Already knew what she'd say. Already processing her words before she spoke them. The linear students struggled to follow—sequential perception trying to track temporal omniscience.

The gap between populations visible even in classroom setting.

"Faster-than-light travel required consciousness fragmentation," Sarah continued. "We couldn't make Alcubierre fields safe for linear neurology. So neurology adapted. Restructured. Became temporal. Now we have two populations. Linear humans on Earth and inner planets. Temporal humans in space-based operations. Separate but coexisting."

She paused, experiencing questions from students across multiple probable futures. Anticipating their concerns before they articulated them.

"Is this permanent?" a linear student asked. "Will humanity stay divided?"

"Divided is wrong term. Diversified is accurate. We're single species with multiple experiential modes. Like having both diurnal and nocturnal populations. Different adaptations, shared genetics, compatible reproduction."

"But incompatible consciousness," a temporal student added, experiencing the exchange across multiple moments. "Linear and temporal humans can't truly communicate."

"We can communicate. We just can't share experience. I can explain temporal omniscience to linear humans. They can intellectually understand. But they can't perceive it. The experiential gap is unbridgeable through language alone."

Kenji sat in the back row and listened to Sarah teaching the next generation. She'd aged twenty years but existed across all moments. Past youth. Present middle age. Future death. All equally vivid in her awareness.

"What about regrets?" another student asked. "Do you regret adapting?"

Sarah experienced the question across all moments she'd been asked it. Hundreds of times. Always the same answer across probability waves.

"I regret the cost. My freedom, my linear experience, my normal human consciousness. But I don't regret the outcome. Humanity needed FTL. I helped achieve it. The gain outweighs the loss."

"Even after twenty years?"

"Especially after twenty years. I've experienced two decades across all moments simultaneously. Lived fully in ways linear consciousness can't achieve. That's not diminishment. That's expansion."

The lecture continued. Sarah covering jump drive mechanics, temporal adaptation, social divergence, future projections. The students absorbed information through their different experiential frameworks.

After the lecture, Sarah approached Kenji. "You're older."

"Twenty years will do that. You look the same."

"I experience aging across all moments. Past youth and future death equally present. The progression is less noticeable when you exist across entire lifespan simultaneously."

They walked through campus. Students clustered in mixed linear-temporal groups, attempting cross-experiential communication. Struggling. Succeeding partially. The gap remained but effort bridged small portions.

"The program's still running?" Sarah asked.

"Thirty-five thousand temporal-adapted individuals now. Commercial FTL employs twelve thousand pilots. Another twenty thousand in training. Genetic screening identifies candidates with ninety-eight percent accuracy."

"And the sixteen catastrophic failures from the early program?"

"Remembered. Honored. Their names on memorial walls across the solar system. David Chen died eight years ago. Cellular fragmentation finally exceeded biological sustainability. The others remain in various states of temporal dissociation."

Sarah experienced David's death across multiple moments. Had experienced it when it happened. Would experience it again in memory forever. Temporal omniscience meant nothing was truly past.

"I think about them," she said quietly. "The pilots who fragmented catastrophically. Who paid costs higher than mine. They made this possible too."

"You all did. Forty-three volunteers. Twenty-seven adaptations. Sixteen failures. All contributing to humanity's expansion."

They reached the memorial garden. MIT had installed one five years ago. Names engraved in stone. Flowers planted by families. Linear and temporal students visiting to honor the cost of progress.

Sarah stood before the memorial experiencing all moments simultaneously. Past sacrifice. Present honor. Future legacy. The names existed across her eternal awareness.

"I'm dying," she said casually. "In eleven years. Cellular fragmentation despite portable generators. My body can't sustain temporal consciousness indefinitely."

Kenji felt the words like physical impact. "You've seen this? In probable futures?"

"Eighty-six percent probability. High enough to be nearly certain. My temporal processing requires metabolic resources faster than my body can provide. Eventually, the deficit becomes fatal."

"Can we prevent it?"

"No. The temporal adaptation is permanent. My neural structures require exotic physics support. My cells age at different rates despite selective field generators. The math is inevitable."

"Eleven years."

"Eleven years experiencing all moments. Which means I'm simultaneously dying and continuing to live across those years. Present conversation and future death equally real." Sarah pulled up probability distributions. "But eleven years is enough. The FTL program is established. Temporal communities are thriving. My contribution is complete."

Kenji wanted to argue. Find solutions. Extend her life through better field generators or medical interventions. But Sarah existed across all futures. She'd already experienced every attempt to save her. Knew which succeeded and which failed.

"The portable generators helped," she said, reading his thoughts across temporal probability. "Extended my functional lifespan by eight years. Without them, I'd have died already. So thank you. For those extra years. For the research. For everything."

"It wasn't enough."

"It was exactly enough. Temporal omniscience doesn't need infinite duration. I experience all my moments already. Past, present, future simultaneous. Whether I live thirty more years or eleven doesn't change the totality of my experience."

They sat in the memorial garden. Sarah experiencing her own future memorial. Her name added to the stone. Flowers planted in her honor. Students visiting decades hence to remember the first temporal-adapted pilot.

"Will you tell anyone? About the eleven years?"

"I'll tell everyone. Transparency matters. Future temporal-adapted individuals should know the biological limits. Understand that consciousness fragmentation has metabolic costs. Make informed choices."

"Like you did?"

"Like I tried to. The information wasn't available twenty years ago. Now it is. Future volunteers will know everything. Choose anyway. Because expansion matters more than individual longevity."

Kenji looked at the memorial garden. At the names of pilots who'd sacrificed everything. At the future where Sarah's name would join them.

"Was it worth it?"

Sarah experienced the question across all moments. The eternal question. The one that defined everything.

"Yes. Humanity reached the stars. Established colonies supporting billions. Evolved beyond single-planet species. All because forty-three pilots volunteered to fragment their consciousness across temporal states. That's worth individual sacrifice. Even mine."

"Even eleven years from now?"

"Especially eleven years from now. I'll die experiencing all moments simultaneously. Past sacrifice. Present contribution. Future legacy. All equally real. That's not tragedy. That's completion."

They stayed until sunset. Kenji experiencing it linearly—past light becoming present twilight becoming future darkness. Sarah experiencing it across all moments—dawn and noon and dusk and night all simultaneous.

Two humans sitting together. Incompatible consciousnesses. Shared purpose. Different experiences of the same memorial garden.

The gap between temporal and linear consciousness crystallized in that moment.

They could sit together. Share space. Communicate. But never truly share experience.

That was humanity's divergence. Permanent. Irreversible. The cost of reaching the stars.

Sarah stood as darkness fell. Or had fallen. Or would fall. Temporal omniscience made sunset timing complicated.

"Thank you," she said. "For attending my lecture. For sitting with me. For building the portable generators. For everything."

"Thank you for volunteering. For adapting. For the twenty years—and the eleven remaining—of contribution."

She smiled across multiple temporal states. Past gratitude. Present acknowledgment. Future remembrance.

Then she walked away, portable generator humming, experiencing all moments simultaneously while occupying sequential physical space.

Kenji watched her go and felt history's weight. He'd helped create temporal consciousness. Build FTL capability. Transform humanity into multiple experiential modes.

In eleven years, Sarah Chen would die. The first adapted pilot becoming the first biological casualty of sustained temporal omniscience.

But she'd live those eleven years experiencing all moments. Past, present, future simultaneous. Her consciousness spanning temporal states until biology failed.

That was the cost. The price. The sacrifice that made expansion possible.

Sarah had paid it willingly.

Would continue paying it across all remaining moments.

Until the inevitable end.

Which she was already experiencing.

Right now.

Forever.

In eternal temporal omniscience.

The gift and curse of adapted consciousness.

The price of reaching the stars.
