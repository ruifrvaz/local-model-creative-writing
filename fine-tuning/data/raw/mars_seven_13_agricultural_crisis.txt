Yuki stood in the greenhouse, surrounded by the colony's food supply, and tried not to panic.

The wheat was dying.

Not all of it. Not yet. But Section C showed clear signs of nutrient deficiency—yellowing leaves, stunted growth, reduced grain production.

She ran another soil analysis. The results were the same as the last three tests.

Nitrogen depletion. Despite the careful cycling of organic waste, despite the bacterial cultures that should have been fixing atmospheric nitrogen, despite every protocol they'd followed.

The soil was dying.

"How bad?" Dr. Omar Hassan appeared beside her. Yuki had called him twenty minutes ago, asking for a geology consult.

"Bad. We're losing nitrogen faster than we can replenish it. Another month at this rate and the whole crop fails." Yuki pulled up the growth projections. "Which means the colony goes on emergency rations. Which means we're dependent on Earth for food shipments again."

"Which defeats the entire point of being self-sufficient." Hassan crouched and examined the wheat. "Walk me through the cycle."

Yuki explained the system. Waste from the crew went to composting. Bacteria broke it down, releasing nitrogen. That nitrogen fed the plants. Plants fed the crew. Perfect closed loop.

In theory.

"But it's not closed," Hassan said. "Where's the nitrogen going?"

"I don't know. That's why I called you. Could it be geological? Absorption into the Martian substrate somehow?"

Hassan pulled out his sampling kit and collected soil from several locations. "Let me run some tests. Could be chemical interaction with local minerals. Mars has high perchlorate content—that might be binding the nitrogen in ways we haven't accounted for."

He left Yuki alone with her dying wheat.

She pulled up the agricultural protocols and read through them again. Everything was by the book. Earth-tested, Mars-adapted, supposedly foolproof.

Except it was failing.

Yuki sat on the greenhouse floor and allowed herself five minutes of despair. Five minutes to imagine the colony starving, the mission failing, everything they'd built collapsing because of soil chemistry.

Then she stood up and got to work.

If the current system wasn't working, she'd design a new one. Hydroponics, maybe. Or aeroponic systems that didn't rely on soil at all. Something that could deliver nutrients directly to plant roots without depending on Martian chemistry.

She spent the afternoon running calculations. Water requirements. Nutrient solutions. Energy costs. Space utilization.

The numbers weren't encouraging. Converting the entire greenhouse to hydroponics would cost more than their annual agriculture budget. Would take six months. Would require materials they didn't have.

But it would work.

Hassan returned with his analysis results three hours later.

"You were right. It's geological." He pulled up spectroscopy data. "The Martian regolith we're using as substrate contains iron oxides that form complexes with nitrogen under specific pH conditions. Basically, the soil is eating your fertilizer."

"Can we fix it?"

"Maybe. If we alter the pH—make it more alkaline—we might disrupt the complex formation." Hassan pulled up chemical equations that made Yuki's head hurt. "Or we could try sequestration barriers. Something that physically separates the Earth soil from the Martian substrate."

"How fast can we implement that?"

"pH adjustment? A week. Barriers? Three weeks, maybe four." Hassan met her eyes. "But Yuki, this is a temporary fix. Eventually, the Martian chemistry will overwhelm any barrier we put up. You need a long-term solution."

Yuki showed him her hydroponics calculations.

Hassan whistled. "That's ambitious."

"That's necessary. We can't keep fighting Mars every growing season. We need systems that don't depend on soil chemistry at all."

"And the cost?"

"Catastrophic. But so is famine." Yuki saved the files. "I'll present it to Rivera. See if we can get corporate to allocate emergency funding."

"They'll say no."

"Then we'll find another way. We always do."

Yuki scheduled a meeting with Rivera for that evening and spent the intervening time strengthening her proposal. Cost projections. Implementation timeline. Risk analysis. Everything corporate would want to see.

Rivera listened to the presentation without interrupting. When Yuki finished, she was quiet for a long moment.

"You're asking for three times our annual agriculture budget."

"I'm asking to ensure we don't starve."

"Corporate won't see it that way. They'll see an unproven technology and a massive expenditure." Rivera pulled up the budget reports. "But you're right. We need to do this. So here's what we're going to do."

She outlined a phased approach. pH adjustment now, as a stopgap. Hydroponics pilot program in Section A, funded from discretionary reserves. If it worked, they'd expand using money reallocated from other departments.

"I can get you enough to convert one section," Rivera said. "Make it count. Prove the concept works. Then we'll fight for more."

It wasn't everything Yuki wanted. But it was enough to start.

"Thank you, Commander."

"Don't thank me yet. You still have to make it work." Rivera smiled. "And Yuki? Start thinking about crop diversity. If we're rebuilding the system anyway, let's make it more resilient. Wheat is great, but we need variety."

Yuki left with authorization codes and a daunting task list. One section. Six weeks. Proof of concept that would determine whether the colony could feed itself or remain dependent on Earth.

No pressure.

She pulled Marcus Wu into the project, along with a botanist named Chen and a chemist named Okoye. Together they designed the first hydroponic system—racks of vertical growing beds, LED lighting tuned to optimal photosynthetic frequencies, nutrient delivery via automated pumps.

It was beautiful. Efficient. Completely unproven at Mars scale.

They built it in Section A over four weeks of eighteen-hour days. Plumbing. Wiring. Structural support. Yuki personally calibrated every nutrient feed.

The wheat seeds went in on day twenty-nine.

And then they waited.

Germination took three days. The first green shoots appeared on day four. By week two, the growth rate was outpacing the soil-based sections.

By week four, it was clear the system worked.

Yuki stood in Section A, surrounded by thriving wheat grown without a gram of Martian soil, and felt tears sting her eyes.

They'd done it. Proven it could work.

Rivera arrived to see the results. She walked through the rows, touching leaves, examining grain heads, checking the monitoring systems.

"Yield projections?"

"Twenty percent higher than soil-based growing. And we can stack the racks—triple our growing capacity in the same space." Yuki pulled up the data. "If we convert all sections, we could support six hundred people instead of four hundred."

"And the cost?"

"Still catastrophic. But spread over two years, manageable." Yuki handed over the revised budget. "I've found ways to fabricate most components locally. Reduces shipping costs by sixty percent."

Rivera studied the numbers. "This is good work, Yuki. Really good."

"So we can proceed?"

"I'll send the proposal to corporate. But don't hold your breath waiting for approval." Rivera looked at the wheat. "However, I do have discretionary funds for 'emergency agricultural improvements.' I can probably stretch that to cover Section B. Get started on that next."

It was approval by technicality. But Yuki would take it.

"Thank you, Commander."

"Thank yourself. You solved a problem that could have killed this colony." Rivera headed for the door. "Keep me updated on the Section B conversion."

Yuki stood alone in her new greenhouse and allowed herself a moment of pride.

The soil had been dying. The colony had been at risk.

And she'd fixed it.

One problem at a time. One solution at a time. One victory at a time.

That was how you built something that lasted on Mars.

Yuki checked the nutrient levels one more time, made a minor adjustment, and headed for her quarters.

Tomorrow she'd start planning Section B.

Tonight, she'd sleep knowing four hundred people had enough to eat.

Small victories.

They kept you going when everything else seemed impossible.
