Field Lead Marcus Osei sat in base camp and watched the crystalline organisms through the observation feed.

They'd been monitoring for five days. The organisms grew. Slowly. Deliberately. Creating patterns that looked almost intentional.

"Coffee?" Ensign Rafael Diaz offered a steaming cup.

Marcus took it. Real coffee was a luxury on exoplanet missions. Most expeditions ran on synthesized caffeine. But Rafael had smuggled actual beans in his personal allotment.

"Thanks. Any changes overnight?"

"Growth rate increased by point-three percent. Still following the same geometric pattern." Rafael pulled up the time-lapse. "Watch the cluster on the ridge. It's building something."

Marcus watched the crystalline structures extend. Branch. Connect. Over forty-eight hours, they'd formed a lattice structure spanning three meters.

"It's not random," Marcus said.

"No. It's organized. Purposeful." Rafael zoomed in on the connection points. "And look at this. The growth follows mathematical ratios. Golden ratio, specifically."

"Natural selection produces efficient forms."

"This efficient? This precise?" Rafael highlighted the measurements. "Marcus, these organisms are constructing to specifications. Like they're following a blueprint."

Marcus thought about Dr. Kapoor's analysis. The organisms metabolized inert materials. Produced localized atmospheric changes. Grew in geometric patterns.

Everything suggested design. Nothing proved it.

"We're scientists, not conspiracy theorists," Marcus said. "We document what we observe. We don't speculate beyond the data."

"The data suggests intelligence."

"The data suggests complexity. Intelligence is an interpretation."

Rafael was quiet for a moment. "You sound like you're trying to convince yourself."

"Maybe I am."

They watched the observation feed in silence. The organisms glowed faintly in Kepler-452c's twilight. Beautiful. Alien. Possibly intentional.

Dr. Kapoor appeared in the doorway. "Marcus, we've got a problem."

"Define problem."

"The organisms we collected are reproducing. Inside the containment. Triple-sealed, supposedly inert containers. They're growing."

Marcus felt cold wash through him. "Reproduction means they're alive."

"And adaptive. They're finding ways to metabolize materials we thought were impossible to break down."

They moved to the portable lab. Priya pulled up the containment feeds.

The samples had indeed grown. Tripled in size over seventy-two hours. The containment vessels showed stress fractures where the organisms had metabolized plastic, metal, even the supposedly inert glass.

"How?" Marcus asked.

"Best guess? They're not metabolizing in the conventional sense. They're directly converting matter to energy at the molecular level. Breaking atomic bonds and harvesting the energy."

"That's fusion."

"Cold fusion. At room temperature. Using biological—or bio-mechanical—processes we don't understand."

Marcus pulled up the contamination protocols. "We need to incinerate these samples. Can't risk them spreading."

"Marcus, these could be the most significant biological discovery in history."

"Or the most dangerous. We don't know what they'll do if they spread."

"They've been on this planet for however long. They're stable. Contained to specific regions."

"Until we disrupted them. Exposed them to new materials. New conditions." Marcus activated the incineration sequence. "We can't take the risk."

Priya wanted to argue. Marcus saw it in her eyes. The scientific instinct to preserve, to study, to understand.

But survival instincts won. "Okay. Incinerate the samples. But I want to increase surface monitoring. If these things are spreading naturally, we need to know."

The incineration took three hours. High-temperature plasma sufficient to break down molecular structures. When it was done, not even atoms remained of the samples.

Marcus felt like he'd destroyed something irreplaceable.

The team expanded their surface monitoring. Drones scanning the organism clusters. Atmospheric sensors tracking changes. Geological surveys mapping the crystalline growth patterns.

Three days later, Dr. Zhang reported anomalies.

"The oxygen production is increasing. Not dramatically, but measurably. Point-five percent higher than baseline." She pulled up atmospheric models. "At current rate, the entire planet will have Earth-normal oxygen levels in about four hundred years."

"That's terraforming," Rafael said.

"Or natural atmospheric evolution," Marcus countered.

"Four hundred years is a blink of an eye in planetary terms. This is accelerated change."

Marcus pulled up the geological record from their core samples. "What does the planet's history show? Has this happened before?"

Zhang ran the analysis. "Oxygen levels have been rising steadily for the past two thousand years. Accelerating over the last five hundred."

"Correlation with the organism presence?"

"Perfect correlation. Where they grow, oxygen increases."

The team assembled in base camp. Marcus laid out the evidence.

Organisms that metabolize inert materials. Create geometric structures. Produce oxygen. Follow mathematical patterns in their growth.

Individually, each observation could be natural. Collectively, they suggested engineering.

"We need to report this to Earth," Priya said.

"And say what? That we think we've found engineered life?" Marcus pulled up the mission protocols. "That's first contact territory. Way beyond our authority."

"So we sit on the most significant discovery in human history?"

"We document it. Thoroughly. And we let Earth decide how to proceed."

Rafael raised a hand. "What if Earth's decision is wrong? What if they send military first, scientists second?"

"That's not our call."

"It should be. We're here. We found it. We understand the context."

Marcus thought about chain of command. About protocols designed for situations that nobody had really imagined. About the responsibility of discovery.

"We send the data," he said. "Complete documentation. Recommendations from a scientific perspective. And we trust that Earth will make the right decision."

"And if they don't?"

"Then we're just scientists on an exoplanet. We don't have the authority or resources to do anything differently."

The report took two days to compile. Every observation. Every measurement. Every theory about what the organisms might be.

Marcus included a personal note.

"Recommendation: approach with caution and respect. If these organisms are engineered, they represent intelligence capable of planetary-scale engineering. If they're natural, they represent biological processes we don't understand. Either way, they deserve careful study, not exploitation."

The message transmitted. Light-speed communication meant Earth wouldn't receive it for two hundred years. By the time response came, everyone on the current expedition would be long dead.

But the data would persist. The discovery would matter.

Marcus stood outside base camp and watched the organisms on the ridge line. They glowed in the alien sunset, building their geometric structures, slowly transforming the atmosphere.

"Think anyone's watching us?" Rafael asked.

"Watching us what?"

"Watching us discover them. If they're engineered, maybe the engineers are still around. Observing how we react."

Marcus hadn't considered that. But now that Rafael mentioned it, the possibility felt uncomfortable.

"If they are watching, let's hope we're making a good impression."

"By incinerating their creations?"

"By being careful. By not exploiting what we don't understand."

They watched the organisms grow. Slow. Patient. Purposeful.

Building something. Or someone.

And Marcus wondered if humanity was ready for the answer to which.
