Chen "Wrench" Liu found the sabotage at midnight, ship time.

The life support compressor had been modified. Subtle work—almost professional. A pressure valve set to fail under specific load conditions. Another few hours of operation and the whole system would have cascaded into catastrophic failure.

They'd all suffocate in their sleep.

Wrench pulled the modified valve and examined it under his workbench magnifier. The adjustment was precise. Done by someone who knew ship systems intimately. Someone with access to engineering tools and the skill to use them.

Someone on his crew.

He sealed the valve in an evidence bag and made his way to Jax's quarters. The captain was awake, reviewing mineral assay reports with the kind of focus that suggested he wasn't sleeping much lately.

"We have a problem," Wrench said.

Jax looked up. Saw the valve. His expression went cold.

"Sabotage?"

"Professional grade. Someone who knows what they're doing." Wrench set the valve on the desk. "Another six hours and we'd have been breathing vacuum."

Jax picked up the valve, turning it over in his hands. "When was it modified?"

"Sometime in the last forty-eight hours. I did a full maintenance check two days ago. This wasn't there then." Wrench pulled up the crew access logs. "Seven people entered engineering during that window. All of them with legitimate reasons."

"Including you."

"Including me," Wrench agreed. "But I'm telling you about it instead of letting us all die, so maybe cross me off the suspect list."

Jax almost smiled. Then the gravity of the situation reasserted itself. "Someone on this ship wants us dead. Or wants to destroy the exotic matter sample before we can deliver it."

"Or both." Wrench highlighted the crew roster. "Sofia's been exhibiting unusual behavior since she absorbed the sample. Kayla's been encrypting personal communications. You've been making secret deals with potential buyers. And I've been—"

"Fixing things that keep getting broken," Jax finished. "Which makes you the most likely to notice sabotage. Unless you're covering your own tracks."

They looked at each other. Six years of trust, suddenly fragile.

"I didn't do this," Wrench said quietly.

"I believe you. But belief doesn't solve the problem." Jax activated the ship's internal monitoring. "We need to know who's moving where. Full surveillance until we find whoever did this."

"That violates crew privacy protocols."

"So does murder." Jax pulled up the feed from the engineering bay. "I'll review the footage personally. Find out who had access to the compressor."

Wrench nodded and returned to engineering. He had repairs to make. And systems to secure against further sabotage. If someone wanted them dead, they'd try again.

The question was who and why.

He spent the next hour reinforcing critical systems. Installing secondary failsafes. Creating alarm triggers that would alert him if anyone tampered with life support, navigation, or communications.

"Wrench, we need to talk." Sofia Ruiz appeared in the engineering bay doorway. Her eyes glowed faintly blue—the exotic matter still integrating with her biology. "I know about the valve."

Wrench's hand moved toward the plasma torch. Not a weapon. But it could be if necessary.

"How do you know?"

"I can feel the ship's systems. Ever since I absorbed the sample, I'm connected to the electrical grid somehow. I sense fluctuations, modifications, anomalies." Sofia held up her hands. The blue glow intensified. "Someone's been changing things. Subtle sabotage across multiple systems. Not just life support."

"Show me."

Sofia moved to the engineering console. Her fingers didn't touch the interface—instead, the displays responded to her proximity. Screens activated. Data streams appeared. Diagnostic protocols ran without input commands.

"The exotic matter integrated with my nervous system," she said. "Turned me into a living interface. I can control ship systems through electromagnetic fields my body generates."

"That's impossible."

"So is glowing blue and surviving exposure to physics-breaking elements. But here we are." Sofia highlighted three subsystems. "Navigation, communications, and weapons. All modified in the last week. Small changes that compound into major failures under stress conditions."

Wrench examined the data. She was right. The sabotage was extensive. Coordinated. Someone had systematically weakened every critical system.

"Who did this?" he asked.

"I don't know. But I know when. All the modifications happened during third shift. When only one person is on duty." Sofia pulled up the rotation schedule. "Kayla. She's been alone in the cockpit every night for the past eight days."

Wrench felt his stomach sink. Kayla Okonkwo. Their pilot. The woman who'd flown them through asteroid fields and solar storms without breaking a sweat.

"Are you sure?"

"The modifications correlate perfectly with her shift times. And she has the skill set—pilot training includes emergency repairs, which means she knows how to make systems fail in controlled ways." Sofia's glow dimmed slightly. "I don't want it to be her. But the data doesn't lie."

"We tell Jax."

"Already did. He's confronting her now." Sofia looked at the engineering bay. "Wrench, whatever happens next, we need to be ready. If Kayla's working for someone—Helios, corporate, whoever—she might not be alone. There could be others."

Wrench nodded. He activated his emergency protocols. Sealed the engineering bay. Armed the internal security systems.

If this turned into a confrontation, he wanted to control the battlefield.

They found Jax in the cargo hold with Kayla. The pilot's hands were bound. Her expression was defiant.

"Tell them," Jax said quietly.

"Tell them what? That I tried to save our lives by destroying the sample before it destroys us?" Kayla looked at Sofia. "Look at her. She's not human anymore. The exotic matter is converting her into something else. And you want to sell that to the highest bidder? To turn it into a weapon?"

"We want to help people," Sofia said.

"By spreading contamination that rewrites human biology? By creating technology that violates physics and probably causality?" Kayla shook her head. "I've been talking to Earth. To scientists who understand what that material really is. It's not a power source. It's a seed. Something designed to convert organic matter into itself. A gray goo scenario waiting to happen."

"You've been reporting to Earth?" Jax's voice was dangerous. "Telling them our location? Our plans?"

"I've been trying to stop a catastrophe. Someone has to think about consequences beyond profit." Kayla met his eyes. "Jax, if we deliver this sample, if we let it spread, humanity ends. Not dramatically. Slowly. We become something else. Something that might be better or might be worse, but either way, we stop being us."

Wrench looked at Sofia. At the blue glow beneath her skin. At the evidence of transformation already happening.

"She has a point," he said quietly.

"She committed sabotage," Jax countered. "Nearly killed us all."

"I set failsafes that would activate when we reached a populated station. Give people time to evacuate before the exotic matter could spread." Kayla's voice was steady. "I wasn't trying to kill you. I was trying to contain you."

"By destroying our ship?"

"By preventing you from spreading contamination that could end human civilization." Kayla looked at each of them. "Someone had to make the hard choice. I chose."

The cargo hold went silent. Wrench felt the weight of it. They'd found something extraordinary. Something that could solve energy crises or end humanity. And now they had to decide which.

"Vote," Jax said finally. "We're a crew. We decide together. Do we deliver the sample or destroy it?"

Wrench looked at the exotic matter container. At Sofia's transformed body. At Kayla's bound hands and desperate expression.

He thought about the people on Earth. The billions who needed power. The civilizations that could thrive or die based on what they decided here.

And he thought about the risk. The contamination. The possibility that Kayla was right and they were carrying humanity's extinction in their cargo hold.

"I abstain," he said. "This is bigger than me. Bigger than all of us."

"That's not an option," Jax said.

"Then make it one. Because I don't have the wisdom to choose between saving people and saving humanity. And neither do you."

The statement hung in the recycled air. Wrench watched his crew grapple with it.

They'd come out here looking for wealth. Instead, they'd found responsibility.

And responsibility, it turned out, was the heaviest cargo of all.
