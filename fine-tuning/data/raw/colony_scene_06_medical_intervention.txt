Dr. Patel watched the blood work results scroll past and tried to keep his expression neutral.

Yuki sat across from him, exhausted but trying to hide it. Dark circles under her eyes. Weight loss. Tremor in her hands when she thought nobody was looking.

"Your iron levels are low," he said. "Vitamin D is borderline deficient. And your cortisol markers suggest chronic stress."

"So, normal for Mars," Yuki said.

"Normal doesn't mean acceptable." Patel pulled up her history. "You've lost four kilos in the past month. Sleep quality is down forty percent. And you're showing early markers of bone density loss."

Yuki's expression tightened. "The gravity here is point-three-eight G. Everyone's losing bone density."

"Not at your rate." Patel leaned forward. "You're working doubles, eating half-rations, and running yourself into the ground. Your body is cannibalizing itself."

"I don't have a choice."

"You have choices. You're choosing not to make them."

Yuki stood up. "Are we done?"

"No." Patel gestured to the chair. "Sit down. Please."

She hesitated, then complied. The defiance in her eyes was almost convincing.

"I'm going to ask you something, and I need an honest answer," Patel said. "When was the last time you felt okay?"

The question hung in the sterile air. Yuki looked away, focusing on the medical equipment. The life support monitors. Anything but Patel's eyes.

"I don't remember," she said finally.

"That's what I thought." Patel pulled up the colony's health statistics. "You're not alone. Seventy percent of the crew is showing elevated stress markers. Half have disrupted sleep patterns. We're running on fumes and calling it normal."

"What else are we supposed to do? The work doesn't stop."

"The work will still be there if you collapse. But you won't." Patel closed his tablet. "I'm recommending mandatory rest protocols. Rotating three-day recovery periods for everyone, starting with you."

"I can't take three days off. The systems—"

"The systems will be managed by someone else. That's why we cross-train." Patel's voice was firm. "This isn't a request, Yuki. It's medical necessity. You're grounded until your numbers improve."

Anger flashed across her face. "You can't ground me. I'm the only one who understands the full life support architecture."

"Then you should've trained someone else. But you didn't, because you thought you were indispensable." Patel met her glare without flinching. "You're not. Nobody is. And pretending otherwise gets people killed."

Yuki was silent for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was quieter. "If I stop, who picks up the slack?"

"We all do. That's how teams work."

"This isn't a team. It's a skeleton crew running systems designed for three times our number."

"I know." Patel's expression softened. "I know how hard you're working. How much you've sacrificed. But you can't pour from an empty cup, Yuki. Right now, you're running on empty."

She looked at her hands. The tremor was visible now, no longer hidden by force of will.

"How bad is it?" she asked quietly.

"Bad enough that another month at this pace will cause permanent damage. Bone loss that won't recover. Organ stress that leads to failure." Patel pulled up the projections. "Your body is in survival mode. It's breaking down muscle tissue for energy. Pulling calcium from your bones. If we don't intervene now, you won't make it to the next supply rotation."

Yuki stared at the data. Numbers that represented her slow dissolution.

"I'm supposed to be stronger than this," she said.

"You're human. Humans have limits."

"Mars doesn't care about limits."

"No. But I do." Patel prepared an injection. "This is a vitamin supplement. High-dose iron, calcium, D3. It'll help short-term, but you need rest. Real rest. Not eight hours of half-sleep between emergencies."

He administered the injection. Yuki barely flinched.

"Three days," Patel said. "You're relieved of duty. I'll coordinate with Rivera to distribute your responsibilities."

"And if something breaks?"

"Then someone else fixes it. Or it stays broken until you're back." Patel saved her medical file. "The colony survived before you got here. It'll survive three days without you."

After she left, Patel pulled up the crew's aggregate health data. The picture was grim. Everyone was declining. Just like Yuki—slowly, incrementally, trying to ignore the warning signs.

Mars was grinding them down. Not through catastrophe, but through relentless attrition. Every day a little harder. Every system a little more strained. Every person a little more broken.

He sent a report to Rivera. Flagged priority.

Twenty minutes later, Rivera was in his office.

"How bad?" she asked.

"Unsustainable." Patel pulled up the projections. "At current rates, we'll start seeing serious medical issues within three months. Stress fractures, cardiovascular problems, immune system collapse. And that's assuming no major emergencies."

Rivera studied the data. "Recommendations?"

"Mandatory rest rotations. Better nutrition—I know we're on rations, but we need to prioritize crew health. And we need more people. This colony was designed for a hundred. We're running it with thirty-seven."

"Corporate says we're overstaffed."

"Corporate is wrong." Patel's voice was flat. "We're not overstaffed. We're understaffed and overworked and one disaster away from complete breakdown."

Rivera nodded slowly. "I'll talk to Earth. Push for additional personnel on the next rotation."

"And in the meantime?"

"Mandatory rest protocols. Starting immediately." Rivera pulled up the duty roster. "We implement rotating rest days. Nobody works more than six days straight. And we cut non-essential operations."

"That'll slow progress."

"Progress doesn't matter if everyone's too sick to work." Rivera closed her tablet. "This is survival, not a sprint. We pace ourselves or we fail."

Patel felt relief wash through him. He'd expected resistance. Instead, Rivera had listened.

"Thank you," he said.

"Don't thank me. Thank Yuki for being the canary in the coal mine." Rivera headed for the door. "Get me a list of everyone who needs immediate intervention. I'll make sure they get it."

After she left, Patel started reviewing files. Crew by crew, system by system. Documenting the slow breakdown.

Chen showed elevated blood pressure. Stress-induced.

Alexis had developed a chronic cough. Probably dust exposure.

Omar's sleep patterns were erratic. Classic overwork syndrome.

Even Rivera herself showed markers of exhaustion and stress.

Mars didn't discriminate. It ground everyone down equally.

Patel prepared his intervention list. Five crew members needed immediate rest. Ten more needed close monitoring. The rest were manageable with the new protocols.

It wasn't a solution. Just a stopgap. But on Mars, sometimes stopgap was the best you could hope for.

He pulled up the colony's mission timeline. They'd been here six months. The planned tour was eighteen months total.

Twelve more months of this.

Patel wondered how many of them would make it.

His comm buzzed. Yuki's voice, subdued. "Doc? I'm in my quarters. The shaking won't stop."

"On my way."

Patel grabbed his medical kit and ran. In the confined space of Mars habitat, emergencies could escalate fast.

He found Yuki on her bunk, curled in on herself. The tremor had spread—hands, arms, shoulders. Her breathing was rapid and shallow.

"Panic attack," Patel said. "Or your body finally giving up the fight. Either way, you're done for the week."

He administered a sedative. Mild, just enough to calm the nervous system. Yuki's breathing slowed. The tremor eased.

"I can't be weak," she whispered.

"This isn't weakness. This is your body telling you it needs help." Patel checked her vitals. "Listen to it. Before it's too late."

Yuki closed her eyes. Within minutes, she was asleep. Real sleep, not the half-conscious state she'd been running on for weeks.

Patel stayed until he was sure she was stable. Then he returned to medical and updated her file.

Mandatory rest: seven days minimum. With close monitoring for psychological breakdown.

Mars had claimed another casualty. Not through explosion or equipment failure. Through the slow, grinding attrition of pushing too hard for too long.

Patel wondered how many more would fall before someone admitted the mission was impossible.

Or before they made it possible through sheer stubborn refusal to quit.

Either way, he'd be there. Patching people up. Holding the line.

Because on Mars, that's what doctors did.
