The engineering bay smelled of machine oil and recycled air. Malik ran diagnostics on the main drive coupling, watching numbers that told a story of gradual failure. Two centuries of continuous operation had worn tolerances down to dangerous margins.

His tablet chimed. Personal message from Sofia Chen, his wife.

*Need to talk. Our quarters. Now.*

Malik finished the diagnostic sequence, logged the results, and headed aft. The corridors were quieter than usual. Crew members nodded as he passed but didn't make eye contact. The referendum had everyone on edge.

Sofia was waiting in their compartment, sitting on their bunk with a data pad in her hands. She looked up when he entered, and he saw it immediately. Fear and determination in equal measure.

"I'm pregnant."

The words hung in the small space. Malik felt his heart rate spike, his thoughts scattering. They'd been trying for months, but the timing—

"The genetic screening—" he started.

"Came back clear. No markers for the hereditary disorders in either of our family lines. Dr. Okoye says it's a healthy pregnancy."

Relief flooded through him. Then reality crashed back. "The vote is in twelve days."

"I know."

Malik sat beside her on the bunk. Their compartment was eight meters square, carved from the ship's habitable sections like every other crew quarters. Not much space for two people. Less for three.

"If we divert to HD 85512, the baby will be born during the deceleration phase," Sofia said. "Okoye says that's medically manageable."

"And if we continue to Tau Ceti?"

"The baby grows up on the ship. Like we did. Like our parents did."

Malik pulled up the structural projections on his tablet. He'd been staring at them for weeks, knew every stress point and failure mode. "If we continue to Tau Ceti, our child might live their entire life on a deteriorating vessel. And their children. And their children."

"You don't know that. The ship might hold together."

"I'm the chief structural engineer, Sofia. I know exactly how likely that is." He highlighted the critical sections. "We have sixty to eighty years before major systems start failing. That's two, maybe three generations. Our grandchildren could be the ones dealing with catastrophic hull breaches."

Sofia set her data pad aside. "Or they could be the ones who make it to Tau Ceti and establish humanity's first extrasolar colony. The mission our great-grandparents died for."

"You're romanticizing it."

"I'm honoring it. There's a difference."

Malik stood, paced the small space. Four steps one way, four steps back. The confines of ship life. "I've been calculating the resources required for a child. Water allocation, food production, life support capacity, medical care. Every new birth puts strain on systems that are already degraded."

"So you're saying we shouldn't have children?"

"I'm saying we need to be realistic about what we're asking them to inherit."

Sofia's expression hardened. "My parents asked me to inherit a mission. So did yours. We accepted that inheritance. Why wouldn't our child?"

"Because we have a choice they didn't. We can give our child a world to grow up on instead of a failing ship in deep space."

"HD 85512 isn't a world. It's a marginal rock with barely breathable atmosphere and hostile conditions. You've seen the environmental analysis."

Malik pulled it up, displayed it on the wall screen. Surface temperature swings of sixty degrees Celsius. Atmospheric pressure at seventy percent Earth normal. Limited water resources concentrated at the poles. "It's harsh. But it's real. Solid ground. Real sky. A future that doesn't depend on maintaining failing systems."

"A future where our child grows up struggling to survive instead of being part of humanity's greatest achievement."

"What achievement? We've been flying through empty space for two hundred years. We haven't achieved anything except not dying."

Sofia stood to face him. "We've achieved cultural continuity. We've preserved Earth's knowledge. We've maintained a functioning society in the most hostile environment possible. That's not nothing, Malik."

"It's not enough to justify asking another generation to sacrifice themselves."

"They're not sacrificing themselves. They're continuing the mission."

"The mission is killing us." Malik pulled up the genetic diversity projections. "Okoye's data is clear. We don't have eighteen generations. We have twelve at most before we start seeing serious population-level genetic disorders."

"Which is still enough to reach Tau Ceti."

"If the ship holds together. If we don't have another radiation event. If the life support systems don't fail. That's a lot of ifs to bet our child's life on."

Sofia sat back down, placed a hand on her still-flat stomach. "I've been thinking about what kind of world I want our child to know. A ship where everyone has a role, where community matters, where we're all connected by shared purpose. Or a colony where it's just survival, where we lose the culture and knowledge we've preserved."

"I want our child to know a world where they're not trapped in a metal tube, breathing recycled air, eating synthesized food, never seeing a natural sunrise."

"Romantic again. HD 85512's sunrises will be through a thin, alien atmosphere that might kill us."

"At least it'll be real. Not a simulation on a screen."

They sat in silence. The ship hummed around them, constant and familiar. The sound of home. The sound of a cage.

"How are you voting?" Sofia asked quietly.

"I was going to vote for diversion. Before." Malik met her eyes. "Before I knew we were having a child. Now I don't know."

"I'm voting to continue the mission. I want our child to be part of completing it."

"Even if that means they inherit a dying ship?"

"Even if that means they inherit a challenge. People need purpose, Malik. They need to be part of something larger than themselves. The mission gives us that."

Malik pulled up the timeline projections. If they continued to Tau Ceti, his child would be in their thirties when they arrived. Old enough to be part of the settlement effort. Old enough to have children of their own who'd be born on an alien world.

If they diverted to HD 85512, his child would be nine years old at arrival. Growing up on the ship, then suddenly transitioned to a harsh planetary environment. No gradual adaptation. Just survival.

"I keep thinking about my grandmother," Malik said. "She was born on the ship, lived her whole life here, died fifty years into the journey. Never saw Earth, never saw our destination. Just the ship. Every single day of her seventy-eight years."

"And she was happy. I remember her. She had purpose, community, love. She didn't need planetary gravity to have a meaningful life."

"She also didn't have a choice. We do."

Sofia stood, moved to the wall screen, pulled up an image they both knew well. The departure photo from 2087. Earth in the background, the generation ship in the foreground, thousands of people boarding for a journey they'd never complete.

"They chose for us," she said. "They decided we'd be born in space, raised in space, dedicated to a mission we'd inherit. That decision shaped everything we are. Now we get to choose for our child. Do we honor what we were given, or do we abandon it?"

"Honoring it might kill us."

"Abandoning it might kill us too. Just slower. Just spiritually instead of physically."

Malik studied his wife. Third-generation, like him. Born to the ship, shaped by the mission, carrying the weight of inherited purpose. They'd grown up together, fell in love during engineering training, decided to build a life together in the small spaces allotted by ship regulations.

Now they were creating a new life. And that life would inherit their choices.

"I need to think," he said. "I need to look at all the data again. Engineering, medical, agricultural. I need to be sure."

"You have twelve days."

"We have twelve days. This isn't just my choice."

Sofia placed her hand over her stomach again. "No. It's theirs too. Our child's. And they don't get a vote."

"Which is why we need to choose wisely."

"Or faithfully. Sometimes wisdom and faith point in different directions."

Malik pulled her close, felt her heartbeat against his chest. Two hearts, soon to be three. A family existing in deep space, sustained by technology and hope and the belief that the journey mattered.

"Whatever we choose," he said, "we're doing it together."

"Together," Sofia agreed. "As a family. That's what matters most."

The ship hummed. Their child grew. The vote approached.

And somewhere in the impossible math of generational sacrifice, they'd have to find an answer they could live with.

Or die with.

Together.
