Captain Jax Torres sat across from the independent trader, negotiating for parts she couldn't afford.

"Jump drive components. Military-grade. Difficult to source." The trader, who called himself Vasquez, scrolled through his inventory. "Twenty thousand credits."

"I have twelve thousand. And platinum samples worth another five."

"Platinum's everywhere in the belt. Not exactly rare."

Jax pulled up the assay data. "Not like this. Ninety-seven percent purity. Natural occurrence. No processing required."

Vasquez studied the numbers. His expression didn't change, but Jax saw interest flicker.

"Interesting. Still not twenty thousand."

"What if I throw in mining coordinates? The asteroid we pulled from. You could extract tons."

"If Olympus hasn't claimed it already."

"Olympus doesn't know where it is. We jumped before they could track us."

Vasquez leaned back. "You're running from Olympus. That's a complication."

"That's why I need the parts. Get mobile. Disappear before they find me."

"Or I could report you. Collect Olympus's finder's fee."

Jax's hand moved closer to her sidearm. Not threatening. Just ready.

Vasquez noticed. Smiled. "Relax, Captain. I don't work for corporations. Bad for independent business. But I do need to cover my risk."

"What risk?"

"Olympus finds out I helped you, they blacklist me. I lose access to their supply networks. That's worth more than twenty thousand."

Jax calculated. She had twelve thousand credits. Five thousand in platinum. Nothing else of value except—

The unknown element.

She could trade samples. But that meant revealing its existence. Creating more people who'd want it. More complications.

"I need time to think," she said.

"You've got six hours. Then my ship departs for the inner belt."

Jax returned to Neptune's Pride. Her crew waited in the common area.

"He wants more than we have," she reported.

"How much more?" Kayla asked.

"Three thousand credits. Or equivalent value."

Sofia pulled up the sample inventory. "We could sell the unknown element. Even small amounts would be worth far more than three thousand."

"And attract every corporate interest in the system. No thanks."

"Then what? We can't move without jump drive components."

Chen looked thoughtful. "What about labor? We offer services instead of credits. Maintenance. Repairs. Whatever Vasquez needs."

"He's a trader, not a manufacturer. What would he need us for?"

"Everyone needs something. We find out what and make him an offer he can't refuse."

Jax liked the idea. Creative. Low-risk. She pulled up Vasquez's ship specifications.

Older model. Probably twenty years in service. The maintenance records showed regular repairs. Functional but aging.

"His ship's old. I bet he has deferred maintenance. Stuff that works but could work better."

"We can offer a full system optimization," Chen said. "Engine efficiency. Power distribution. Life support upgrades. Worth thousands in labor if he paid a shipyard."

Jax headed back to Vasquez's ship with the proposal.

He listened. Calculated. Then pulled up his maintenance logs.

"My coolant recycler is inefficient. Losing five percent capacity annually. Can you fix it?"

"Depends on the problem. Give me two hours to diagnose."

Chen and Jax spent the afternoon in Vasquez's engineering bay. The recycler was a mess. Clogged filters. Corroded pumps. Degraded seals.

"This is going to take more than two hours," Chen said.

"Then we work fast and thorough. This is our ticket out of here."

They disassembled the recycler. Cleaned components. Replaced worn parts with better materials from Neptune's Pride's spare inventory.

Eight hours later, the recycler ran at ninety-eight percent efficiency. Better than new.

Vasquez tested it personally. "Impressive. You do good work."

"Do we have a deal?"

"Recycler repairs. Plus twelve thousand credits. Plus the platinum samples. That covers the jump drive components."

Jax felt relief wash over her. "Deal."

They transferred credits and samples. Vasquez delivered the components. Military-grade antimatter injectors. Quantum field generators. Everything Chen needed to rebuild their drive.

As Jax prepared to leave, Vasquez stopped her. "Captain, word of advice. Whatever you found that made Olympus chase you, sell it or hide it. But don't keep it if you want to live quietly."

"Thanks. I'll keep that in mind."

Back on Neptune's Pride, Chen started jump drive installation. "Two weeks minimum. Maybe three."

"We don't have three weeks. Olympus could find us any day."

"Then I work faster and pray the installation doesn't explode."

Jax left him to it. She pulled up navigation charts. Looking for routes out of the belt. Safe harbors. Places Olympus didn't patrol.

The list was depressingly short. Olympus had influence everywhere. Mining stations. Trade routes. Even independent facilities maintained cordial relationships for business reasons.

They needed to disappear completely. Go somewhere corporations didn't bother looking.

The outer system. Beyond Neptune. The Kuiper Belt and scattered disk where independent miners worked claims too distant for corporate profit.

Cold. Isolated. Dangerous.

Perfect.

She plotted coordinates. Six months from Wolf 359 at sublight. Once the jump drive was repaired, they could reach it in hours.

A fresh start. New territory. Away from corporate hunters and political complications.

If they survived the repair period.

Kayla floated onto the bridge. "Sensors show a ship on approach. Transponder identifies it as independent freighter. But the configuration..."

"Is military," Jax finished. She pulled up the visual. "Olympus converted hunter. They're not even hiding it."

"They found us."

"Looks like it. Time to departure?"

"Jump drive's not installed. We're stuck at sublight for another week minimum."

"Then we run. Again. Hope they don't catch us. Again."

Jax initiated emergency departure protocols. Cast off from the station. Boosted away on maneuvering thrusters.

The Olympus ship followed. Slowly closing distance.

"Chen, I need that drive. Now."

"It's in pieces, Jax. I can't—"

"Figure it out. We've got maybe twelve hours before they're in weapons range."

"Twelve hours to rebuild a jump drive from scratch. Sure. No problem. I'll just violate physics and safety protocols."

"That's the spirit."

Chen worked through the night. Jax piloted evasive maneuvers. Kayla monitored the pursuing ship. Sofia ran calculations looking for advantages.

Eight hours in, Chen reported: "I can give you one jump. Maybe. The drive's fifty percent assembled. I can charge it enough for short-range transition."

"How short?"

"Three light-days. Maybe four. Nowhere near what we need but better than nothing."

"Do it."

The drive came online with a sick whine. Harmonics were wrong. Energy distribution unstable. But it was functional. Barely.

"Jump field forming," Chen reported. "But it's unstable. Fifty-fifty on whether we make it through intact."

"Better odds than staying here."

Jax triggered the jump. Reality twisted. The Neptune's Pride screamed as quantum fields tore at partially assembled components.

Then they were through. Different space. No pursuit.

But Chen's voice over the comm was grim. "Drive's completely fried. We destroyed it jumping."

Jax pulled up their position. Three light-days from Wolf 359. Weeks away at sublight. With no jump capability and finite supplies.

"At least we're not caught," she said.

"Just stranded. In the dark. With Olympus probably tracking our jump signature."

"Details." Jax pulled up their resource inventory. "We limp to somewhere safe. Disappear. Start over."

"With what? We just spent everything on parts we destroyed using."

"With determination. Improvisation. And refusal to quit."

It wasn't much. But it was all they had. The independent way. Making impossible work because the alternative was giving up.

And Jax Torres never quit. Never had. Never would.

Even when the universe kept proving how hard survival could be.
