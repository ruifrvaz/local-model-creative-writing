Medical Director James Okoye watched the genetic diversity models deteriorate and tried not to panic.

The projections were clear. Another hundred years, and Perseverance's population would be below viability threshold. Not enough genetic variation to sustain healthy reproduction.

They were dying. Slowly. Invisibly. But inevitably.

Captain Reyes appeared in medical, tablet in hand. "You called?"

"I wanted to show you this privately." James pulled up the genetic analysis. "We're below critical diversity. Faster than the models predicted."

Ana studied the data. Her expression didn't change, but James knew her well enough to see the tension.

"How long?" she asked.

"Eighty years. Maybe ninety if we implement aggressive genetic management."

"Meaning?"

"Controlled breeding. Mandatory genetic compatibility screening. Possible restrictions on reproduction for carriers of certain markers."

"Eugenics."

"Survival." James pulled up the alternative scenarios. "We don't manage the genetics, we arrive at Kepler-442b with a population too inbred to colonize."

"And if we manage it?"

"We might arrive viable. Barely."

Ana sat down. Captain of a generation ship facing extinction through simple mathematics.

"Options," she said.

"The planet we passed. It's still within jump range if we turn around."

"The council voted to continue."

"The council didn't know how bad the genetics were. I've been running new analysis. The degradation is accelerating."

"Why?"

James hesitated. "Environmental stress. Radiation exposure despite shielding. The artificial gravity isn't quite one-G—point-nine-seven. Small difference, but over generations it affects development. And we're seeing increased mutation rates from the fusion reactor proximity."

"The ship is poisoning us."

"The ship is imperfect. And our bodies are adapting in ways that reduce genetic diversity."

Ana pulled up the mission timeline. "We're two hundred years in. Halfway point. If we turn around now—"

"We could be on that planet in three years. Real gravity. Natural radiation shielding from an atmosphere. A chance to rebuild genetic diversity through environmental selection pressure."

"Or we could die trying to colonize a world we don't understand."

"We're already dying. The question is whether we choose how."

They sat in silence. The ship hummed around them—life support, artificial gravity, the systems that kept three thousand people alive in the void.

"I need to bring this to the council," Ana said.

"I know."

"And they're going to panic."

"Probably."

Ana stood. "Prepare a full briefing. Every scenario. Every option. I want the council to make this decision with complete information."

The emergency council meeting assembled within hours. Malik, Eva, the section leaders. Everyone who made decisions for the ship.

James laid out the genetic data. The projections. The timeline to collapse.

The room fell silent.

Eva spoke first. "This is why we should turn back. The planet gives us a chance."

"The planet is unknown risk," Malik countered. "We could arrive and find it uninhabitable."

"We could arrive at Kepler-442b and find it already occupied. Or changed. Or destroyed. Two hundred years is a long time."

"It's the mission."

"The mission is survival. If the genetics are collapsing, the mission is already failing."

Council Member Park pulled up alternative proposals. "What about the embryo banks? We have frozen genetic material from Earth."

"We've been using it," James said. "Integrating new genetics every generation. But it's not enough. The base population is too small. We need environmental diversity, not just genetic diversity."

"Meaning what?"

"Meaning a planet. Real ecosystem. Selection pressures that aren't artificial. The genetics need to adapt to something other than a metal ship."

The debate raged for hours. Turn back versus push forward. Known failure versus unknown risk.

Finally, Ana called for vote. "We have three options. Continue to Kepler-442b with aggressive genetic management. Turn back to the planet we passed. Or find a third option none of us have thought of yet."

"There is no third option," Eva said. "It's the planet or slow extinction."

"Slow extinction might still succeed," Malik said. "The projections aren't certain."

"They're certain enough."

The vote split. Eleven for the planet. Ten for continuing. Five abstentions.

Ana absorbed the result. "Eleven to ten. Not a mandate."

"It's a majority," Eva said.

"Barely. I'm not turning this ship around on a bare majority for a decision this significant."

"Then what do you propose?"

Ana pulled up a proposal. "We send a scout ship. Small crew. Jump back to the planet. Assess its actual viability. If it's suitable, they signal. If not, we know and can proceed to Kepler-442b with no doubts."

"That uses resources we can't spare," Malik said.

"It provides information we can't lack. If that planet is viable, we need to know. If it's not, we need that certainty."

The council debated the compromise. Scout ship. Six crew. Three-year mission to assess and report.

The vote was unanimous.

James volunteered immediately. "I'm medical director. I can assess biological viability better than anyone."

"You're also essential personnel on the ship," Ana said.

"So is everyone. But I want to do this. If there's a chance to save the population, I need to see it myself."

Ana studied him. "You're sure?"

"Yes."

The scout crew assembled over the next week. James. Eva—historian and cultural specialist. A biologist. An engineer. A pilot. And a security officer.

Six people. Three-year commitment. Either they'd find humanity's salvation, or confirm its slow doom.

James stood in the shuttle bay and looked at the scout ship. Small. Fast. Capable of the jump back to the planet they'd passed.

Eva joined him. "Think we'll find something?"

"I think we'll find answers. Whether they're the ones we want, I don't know."

"Better than dying from ignorance."

"Maybe."

The launch was quiet. No ceremony. Just six people boarding a ship and detaching from Perseverance.

James watched the generation ship recede. Two hundred years of travel. Three thousand people whose lives depended on what he found.

The pilot initiated the jump. Reality twisted. When it stabilized, they were in a different star system.

The planet hung before them. Blue and green and promising.

Or deadly. They'd find out which.

"Beginning orbital survey," the pilot said.

James pulled up his biological analysis protocols. Time to find out if this world could save them.

Or if they'd just confirmed their extinction was inevitable.

Either way, they'd know.

And knowing was worth the risk.
