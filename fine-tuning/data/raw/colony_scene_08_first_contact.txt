Omar Hassan descended into the drill shaft and tried not to think about the two hundred meters of Martian rock above his head.

The shaft was narrow. Barely wide enough for a suited human. The walls showed tool marks from the angled drilling—Commander Rivera's compromise between safety and curiosity.

"Omar, you're at one-eighty meters," Alexis's voice through the comm. "How's it look?"

"Tight. But stable." Omar activated his helmet lights. The shaft stretched down into darkness. "I can see the breach point. Another fifteen meters."

"Take it slow. That cavity's been sealed for God knows how long. No telling what happens when you get close."

Omar descended carefully. Magnetic boots clicking against the shaft walls. His suit sensors tracked atmospheric pressure, temperature, radiation.

All nominal. Except for the electromagnetic pulse. It grew stronger with each meter.

Point-eight-seven hertz. Steady. Like a heartbeat.

Or a countdown.

The breach point appeared below him. The drill had punched through into empty space. Blue-green light spilled from the opening.

Omar's sensors went wild. EM field strength spiking. Radiation across multiple spectra. And something else. A harmonic frequency that his equipment couldn't quite classify.

"Omar, we're reading massive field fluctuations. Are you okay?"

"Fine. Just... overwhelmed by the data." He positioned himself at the breach point and looked down.

The cavity opened below him. Twenty meters across, roughly spherical. The walls glowed with bioluminescent patterns. Or technological patterns. The distinction wasn't clear.

At the center, suspended in what looked like antigravity, floated an object.

Spherical. Metallic. About two meters in diameter. Its surface was inscribed with patterns that hurt to look at—like three-dimensional mathematics rendered in physical form.

"I'm seeing something," Omar said. "Object at cavity center. Artificial. Definitely artificial."

"Describe it."

"Sphere. Two meters. Covered in inscriptions or equations. Hovering without visible support." Omar pulled up his spectrometer. "Composition is... I don't even know. It's not reading as any known element."

"Can you get closer?"

"Should I?"

"That's your call. You're the one down there."

Omar thought about it. The smart thing was retreat. Report. Let specialists handle first contact with alien artifacts.

But they'd spent weeks getting to this point. And the cavity was responding to exposure. Each day, the EM pulse strengthened. Whatever timeline the artifact was on, it was accelerating.

"I'm going to approach. Slowly."

He lowered himself through the breach. The cavity's interior had no obvious floor—just the glowing walls and the floating sphere.

Gravity felt wrong here. Light but not zero. Like the cavity had its own field independent of Mars.

Omar drifted toward the sphere. Three meters. Two. One.

The inscriptions shifted.

Omar froze. "The patterns are moving. Responding to my presence."

"Omar, get out of there."

"Wait. This is important."

He pulled his camera close to the sphere's surface. The inscriptions weren't just moving—they were animating. Showing sequences. Equations that built on each other.

Mathematics. Pure mathematics. But more complex than anything Omar had studied.

"It's teaching," he said. "The sphere. It's showing me mathematical proofs."

"Omar—"

"Give me one minute. I need to record this."

He documented the sequences. Captured images. The sphere cycled through what looked like fundamental physics—but expressed in ways that suggested alternative understandings.

Like someone explaining quantum mechanics to a civilization that had only discovered Newtonian physics.

The sphere was showing them how it worked. Or how the universe worked. The translation wasn't clear.

Then the inscriptions stopped. Froze on a single pattern.

And projected.

Light erupted from the sphere. Not harmful—just intensely bright. It formed a holographic interface around Omar.

"Oh God. It's activating."

"Get out now!"

But Omar couldn't move. The light had surrounded him. Was scanning him. He felt it probe his suit. His body. His mind.

Then it released him.

The light withdrew. The sphere's inscriptions returned to their original patterns. And the EM pulse stopped entirely.

Silence in the cavity. The glow dimmed. The sphere's surface became inert metal.

"Omar? Status?"

"I'm okay. I think. The sphere scanned me and then... stopped."

"Stopped what?"

"Everything. It's dormant now. Like it finished whatever it was doing."

Omar backed away from the sphere. The cavity's strange gravity let him drift to the breach point.

"I'm coming up. We need to analyze this."

The ascent took twenty minutes. When Omar emerged, the entire colony was waiting. Commander Rivera, Alexis, Chen, Yuki, everyone.

"What happened down there?" Rivera asked.

Omar pulled off his helmet. "I made contact. Or it made contact with me. The sphere scanned me, then deactivated."

"Did it communicate?"

"It showed me mathematics. Proofs I couldn't follow. Like it was trying to teach me its operating principles."

Dr. Patel was already running medical scans. "You're showing elevated neural activity. Synaptic patterns I've never seen. Did the sphere do something to your brain?"

"I don't know. I feel normal. But I remember the equations. All of them. Like they're burned into my memory."

Alexis pulled up a screen. "Show us."

Omar started writing. The equations flowed from his hands. Complex mathematics that he'd never studied but somehow understood.

The equations described gravity. But not as Einstein had formulated it. As something more fundamental. A property of spacetime that could be manipulated through specific geometric configurations.

"This is breakthrough physics," Alexis said. "Where did you learn this?"

"The sphere. It taught me." Omar kept writing. "And I think it's still teaching. The information is unpacking in my head. Like delayed learning."

Rivera pulled up the containment protocols. "We need to secure the cavity. And Omar, you're under medical observation until we understand what that sphere did to you."

"It gave me knowledge," Omar said. "Information we'd never discover on our own."

"Or it infected you with something we don't understand."

"Maybe both."

They sealed the shaft. Posted guards. Implemented protocols for what the Colonial Authority was already calling "the artifact."

Omar sat in medical while Patel ran every scan available. The equations kept flowing. Faster now. Like downloading data from a source he couldn't identify.

"How much information did it give you?" Patel asked.

"I don't know. It feels infinite. Like opening a door to knowledge I can't fully process."

"Is it hurting?"

"No. But it's overwhelming. I can feel the math even when I'm not thinking about it. Like background noise in my consciousness."

Rivera appeared in medical. "Earth responded. They're sending a full first contact team. ETA forty-five days. Until then, we're to document everything but make no further contact with the artifact."

"It's dormant," Omar said. "I don't think further contact is possible."

"Why?"

"Because it scanned me. Determined what information I could handle. Uploaded it. And then shut down. Like it completed its function."

"What function?"

"Teaching. The sphere isn't a weapon or a tool. It's a library. Knowledge storage. And it's been waiting for someone to find it."

Alexis pulled up geological data. "That cavity has been sealed for millions of years. Tens of millions. Whatever put that sphere there is long gone."

"But they left their knowledge behind," Omar said. "Like a gift. Or a test. For whoever came after."

They sat in medical and contemplated the implications. An ancient civilization. Advanced enough to manipulate gravity. Dead for eons. But their knowledge remained.

Waiting for humanity to find it.

Omar felt the equations pulse in his mind. Fundamental physics. Engineering principles. Mathematics that could reshape civilization.

All downloaded into his brain by a sphere in a Martian cavity.

He started writing again. Documenting what he knew. What he remembered. What the sphere had taught him.

Rivera watched. "Earth's going to want you. For study. For interrogation. For whatever they think you've become."

"I'm still me. Just... augmented."

"Are you sure?"

Omar thought about it honestly. "No. But I'm functional. And the information is real. We can verify the mathematics. Test the engineering principles. If this works, humanity just jumped ahead by centuries."

"If it works," Rivera said. "If it's not some alien trap we don't understand."

"Only one way to find out."

Omar kept writing. The equations kept flowing.

Somewhere in the dark, the sphere waited in its cavity. Dormant. Having fulfilled its purpose.

Teaching the next generation how to reach the stars.
