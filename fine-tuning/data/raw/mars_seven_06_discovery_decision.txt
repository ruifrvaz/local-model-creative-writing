Dr. Omar Hassan stood at the edge of the second borehole and felt his hands shake. Not from cold. Not from exertion.

From what he'd found.

The drill core sat in its analysis chamber, data streaming across his tablet. Another cavity. Same depth. Same diameter. Same thermal signature.

And connected to the first by a tunnel.

"This can't be natural," he said aloud.

Yuki crouched beside him, studying the imaging data. "No, it can't. Omar, we need to report this. Now."

"I know. I just..." He trailed off, staring at the perfect geometry displayed on screen. "Do you understand what this means? If there's an artificial structure down there—"

"Then Mars had a civilization. Or visitors. Or something we don't have words for yet." Yuki stood. "Which is exactly why we need to tell Rivera before we dig any deeper."

Hassan saved the data to three separate drives. Redundancy. If something happened—if corporate tried to suppress this or classify it—he wanted backup.

They found Rivera in her office, reviewing supply manifests. She looked up as they entered.

"Doctor Hassan. Tanaka. You both look like you've seen a ghost."

"Maybe we have." Hassan transferred the borehole data to her display. "Commander, I found something. Something that changes everything."

Rivera studied the images. Her expression went carefully neutral. "Explain."

Hassan walked her through it. The first cavity. The second. The connecting tunnel. The age estimates—three point two billion years. The thermal signatures suggesting the structures had once been much hotter than ambient temperature.

"You're saying this is artificial."

"I'm saying it's not natural. The geometry is too perfect. The spacing too deliberate." Hassan pulled up comparison images. "Here's what meteor impacts look like. Here's what lava tubes look like. Here's what we found. They're not the same."

Rivera was quiet for a long moment. "If you're right, this is the biggest discovery in human history."

"I know."

"It's also far outside our mission parameters. We're here to establish a colony, not conduct archaeological excavations of alien ruins." Rivera closed the file. "Corporate will shut us down. Pull funding. Take over the site. We'll lose everything."

"But the science—"

"Will happen with or without us." Rivera met his eyes. "I'm not saying we hide this. I'm saying we need to be smart about how we handle it. If we report this to Earth right now, what happens?"

Hassan thought about it. "Corporate pulls the discovery team together. Academic institutions fight over jurisdiction. Politicians get involved. Media circus. And we—the people who actually found it—get sidelined."

"Exactly." Rivera pulled up the colony charter. "But if we document it thoroughly first, establish clear chain of discovery, build an ironclad case—then when we go public, we control the narrative."

"You want to delay reporting."

"I want to do it right." Rivera's voice was firm. "Two weeks. You get two weeks to conduct a proper survey. Map the structures. Collect samples. Build a comprehensive data package. Then we send it all to Earth at once, complete and irrefutable."

Yuki spoke up. "Commander, that's a risk. If corporate finds out we sat on this—"

"They'll be too busy dealing with the media firestorm to care about procedure." Rivera pulled up a timeline. "Here's what we do. Hassan, you continue your geological survey—publicly, that's all it is. Yuki, you're assigned to assist with 'water prospecting.' We keep the crew size small. Three people max. Everything documented but kept on local storage only."

"Who's the third person?" Hassan asked.

"Alexis. We'll need engineering expertise to properly assess the structures. And she knows how to keep her mouth shut." Rivera looked at them both. "This stays between us until we're ready. Understood?"

Hassan nodded. His hands were still shaking. Two weeks to study what might be the most important discovery in human history.

No pressure.

"Get me a preliminary survey plan by tomorrow morning," Rivera said. "Conservative estimates, proper safety protocols. If you're going down there, I want to make damn sure you come back up."

"Down there?" Hassan blinked. "You mean—"

"If there's a structure, we need to know what's inside. Remote sensing only gets us so far." Rivera's expression was unreadable. "Unless you think we should just drill holes and hope for the best?"

"No. No, you're right. We need direct observation." Hassan's mind was already racing. "We'll need specialized equipment. Drilling capacity for a human-sized access shaft. Atmospheric sensors. Lighting. Communications relay."

"Make a list. Alexis will tell you what we can fabricate and what we need to source." Rivera stood. "This is happening, doctors. We're going to find out what's down there. But we're going to do it carefully, and we're going to do it right."

After they left, Hassan walked to the laboratory in a daze. Three point two billion years. Older than most rock formations on Earth. Older than complex life.

What had made those cavities? And why?

He pulled up the thermal analysis again. The structures had been hot once—much hotter than surrounding rock. Not volcanic hot. Something else.

Something that generated controlled heat over an extended period.

Like machinery.

Hassan pushed the thought away. Too much speculation, not enough data. But his mind kept circling back to it.

What if Mars hadn't always been dead?

What if something had lived here, built here, and left behind traces?

What if those traces were still functional, waiting in the dark?

He forced himself to focus. Survey plan. Equipment list. Safety protocols. Science first, wild speculation later.

But as he worked, Hassan couldn't shake the feeling that they were on the edge of something vast. Something that would change not just Mars exploration, but humanity's entire understanding of its place in the universe.

Two weeks to find out.

Hassan pulled up a geological map and began planning the excavation. The cavity was forty meters down—deep, but manageable. They'd need to drill a shaft, install a ladder system, set up atmospheric controls.

Figure six days for drilling. Two days for equipment installation. That left six days for exploration and documentation.

Tight. Risky. Absolutely worth it.

He sent the preliminary plan to Alexis with a note: "Need to discuss equipment requirements. This is priority one."

The response came back immediately: "My office. Twenty minutes."

Hassan saved his work and headed for engineering. The corridors were quiet in evening cycle, most of the crew already settling in for the night.

Alexis was waiting with schematics already pulled up. "Rivera briefed me. You want to dig a forty-meter shaft and climb down into an alien structure that's been sealed for three billion years."

"That's the plan."

"Are you insane?"

"Possibly." Hassan pulled up his survey data. "But Alexis, look at this. This is real. This is proof that we're not alone."

She studied the images. He watched her skepticism fade, replaced by wonder.

"Holy shit."

"Yeah."

"Okay. Okay, we can do this." Alexis pulled up drilling specifications. "We've got a bore that can handle this diameter. Take us about four days to drill, another two to install support structures. We'll need atmospheric testing before anyone goes down—could be anything from vacuum to toxic gas to something we've never seen before."

"I'll handle the analysis."

"You're not going down there alone."

"I wasn't planning to." Hassan met her eyes. "I need someone who understands structural engineering. Someone who can assess whether these cavities are stable or about to collapse."

"Me."

"You."

Alexis was quiet for a moment. "If this goes wrong, if the structure collapses or we trigger some kind of automated defense system or—"

"Then we die discovering the most important thing humanity has ever found." Hassan's voice was steady. "I'm going down there, Alexis. With you or without you. But I'd rather have the colony's best engineer watching my back."

She smiled despite herself. "Flattery. Fine. I'm in. But we do this by the book. Every safety protocol, every backup system, every redundancy."

"Agreed."

They worked through the night, planning the excavation. Equipment lists. Safety procedures. Timeline. Contingencies for seventeen different failure modes.

By dawn, they had a plan that was risky but executable.

Hassan sent it to Rivera with shaking hands.

The response came back in ten minutes: "Approved. Begin drilling tomorrow. And Hassan? Don't die. I don't want to explain to Earth why we lost our best geologist to alien archaeology."

Hassan allowed himself a small smile.

Two weeks until they went public.

But tomorrow, they'd start uncovering secrets that had waited three billion years.

Mars kept its mysteries well.

It was time to start revealing them.
