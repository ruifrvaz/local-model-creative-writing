Dr. Kenji Yamamoto watched the test pilot's vital signs deteriorate in real-time. Lieutenant Sarah Chen had been in the jump bubble for ninety-three seconds. Her heart rate was at two hundred beats per minute. Brain activity showed patterns that shouldn't exist in living humans.

"Abort the test," he said.

The technician's hands moved across the controls. "Collapsing the bubble. Thirty seconds to full extraction."

Those thirty seconds felt like hours. Sarah's metrics continued degrading—oxygen saturation dropping, neural coherence fragmenting, cellular stress markers climbing into lethal ranges.

The jump bubble collapsed with a sound like reality tearing. Sarah's test ship materialized in the lab bay, exactly where it had vanished ninety-three seconds earlier.

But ninety-three seconds in normal space. Inside the bubble, Sarah had experienced seventeen minutes.

Kenji ran to the ship. Medical teams were already extracting Sarah from the pilot's seat. She was conscious but disoriented, bleeding from her nose and ears.

"Time?" she gasped.

"Ninety-three seconds local. Seventeen minutes for you. Same as the simulation predicted."

"Felt like hours. Days. Can't... can't reconcile perceptions."

Dr. Aisha Mbara, the medical officer, was running scans. "Severe temporal dislocation syndrome. Her neurons are firing in patterns that don't match current timeflow. Brain thinks it's existed longer than body registers."

"Will she recover?"

"Unknown. We've never had a test pilot survive this long in bubble before. Previous tests failed at thirty seconds."

Kenji felt guilt crushing down. He'd designed the jump drive. Convinced Admiral Kowalski that human testing was necessary. Assured everyone the risks were manageable.

Sarah Chen was paying the price for his confidence.

"Get her to medical. Full neurological workup. I need to understand what's happening in that temporal dislocation."

Back in his lab, Kenji pulled up the jump bubble telemetry. The Alcubierre metric had been stable. Spacetime curvature within predicted parameters. Energy consumption matched theoretical models.

Everything had worked perfectly. Except for the human experiencing it.

The math said FTL travel was possible. Compress space in front, expand it behind, ride the wave between normal spacetime regions at arbitrary velocity. Simple. Elegant.

The biology said humans weren't meant to exist in bubbles of compressed spacetime. That time dilation effects created neurological damage impossible to prevent.

Admiral Kowalski found Kenji staring at equations that refused to resolve. "How's Lieutenant Chen?"

"Stable. Confused. Her perception of time doesn't match reality. She thinks she's been alive seventeen minutes longer than her body has existed."

"That's what happens when you fold spacetime around human consciousness."

"I thought we'd accounted for dilation effects. Built compensators into the bubble geometry. Clearly we were wrong."

Kowalski pulled up the political pressure reports. "Corporate wants FTL capability for interstellar expansion. Military wants strategic advantage. Politicians want to announce breakthrough before next election. Everyone wants this working yesterday."

"And none of them care about jump sickness or temporal psychosis or the fact that our test pilots are developing neurological damage from technology we barely understand."

"They care. They just think the benefits outweigh the costs."

Kenji looked at the test ship. Small craft, barely large enough for a pilot and basic instruments. They'd been testing jump drives for two years. Nineteen pilots total. Eleven had developed permanent neurological conditions. Three had died when their bubbles collapsed catastrophically. Sarah was number nineteen.

And she was the furthest they'd gotten. Ninety-three seconds of actual jump capability.

To reach the nearest star system would require seventeen hours in the bubble. Nobody could survive that. Not with current technology.

"We need to stop," Kenji said. "Pause testing until we understand the biological effects better."

"Can't stop. Program has too much political momentum. We either solve the problems or get replaced by researchers who will."

"You're asking me to kill pilots for political expediency."

"I'm asking you to advance technology that could change humanity's future. Yes, there are costs. There are always costs. The question is whether they're worth paying."

Kenji didn't have an answer. He believed in FTL travel. Believed humanity needed to expand beyond Sol system. Believed the jump drive could work if they solved the remaining problems.

But he also believed in not killing people to get there.

"Give me two weeks," he said. "I'll redesign the bubble geometry. Add better temporal compensation. Maybe we can reduce the dislocation effects."

"Two weeks. Then we resume testing."

Kenji spent those two weeks in his lab, running simulations that showed slight improvements. Twenty percent reduction in dislocation effects. Maybe enough to keep pilots conscious longer.

Maybe enough to keep them sane.

On day fourteen, Sarah Chen returned to work. Against medical advice, against common sense. She walked into Kenji's lab with determination that overrode her obvious physical struggles.

"I want to go again," she said.

"You're not cleared for duty. Medical says another six weeks minimum."

"Medical doesn't understand. I was there, Kenji. In the bubble. I felt spacetime compress around me. Felt velocity that shouldn't be possible. It was beautiful and terrifying and I need to go back."

"You almost died."

"I almost succeeded. Ninety-three seconds is progress. Next time might be two minutes. Time after that, five. Eventually we'll figure out how humans can survive extended jumps."

"Or eventually we'll kill you trying."

Sarah pulled up her own medical data. "Look at my neural patterns. Yes, there's damage. But there's also adaptation. My brain is learning to process temporal dislocation. Give it time, give it training, maybe I can develop tolerance."

"That's speculation."

"Everything about this program is speculation. We're doing things humans have never done. Can't expect perfect safety."

Kenji wanted to refuse. Wanted to protect Sarah from herself. But he saw the determination in her eyes and recognized it.

She was the same as him. Willing to risk everything to make FTL travel work.

"Two more weeks. Let your neural patterns stabilize. Then we'll try again with the improved bubble geometry."

"Deal."

Those two weeks felt like countdown to disaster. Kenji refined his calculations. Aisha developed better medical monitoring protocols. The engineering team reinforced the bubble containment systems.

And Sarah trained. Meditation techniques for managing temporal perception. Cognitive exercises for processing dislocation. Physical conditioning to handle the stress.

On test day, she strapped into the pilot seat like she was going home.

"Ready when you are, Dr. Yamamoto."

Kenji initiated the jump sequence. "Activating bubble in three... two... one."

Reality compressed. Sarah and her ship vanished into a pocket of spacetime traveling faster than light relative to external observers.

One hundred twenty seconds passed. Longer than any previous test. Sarah's vitals showed stress but remained stable.

At one hundred fifty seconds, Kenji gave the abort command. "Collapsing bubble."

The ship materialized. Sarah emerged shaking but conscious. Smiling.

"Twenty-six minutes subjective time. I'm getting better at this. The dislocation is still there, but I can manage it. I can function through it."

Aisha ran her scans. "Neural damage is accumulating. You can't keep doing this."

"Watch me."

And over the next three months, she did. Test after test, pushing the limits of human endurance in compressed spacetime. Learning to navigate temporal dislocation like it was just another flight skill.

The jump drive was working. Sort of.

If you were willing to pay the price.

If you were willing to bet human consciousness could adapt to experiencing time wrong.

If you were willing to sacrifice pieces of yourself for velocity humanity wasn't meant to achieve.

Sarah Chen was willing.

Kenji just hoped that willingness wouldn't kill her.

Before they figured out how to make FTL travel safe.

Or proved it was impossible.

One jump at a time.

One sacrificed piece of sanity at a time.

One step closer to the stars.

Or one step closer to discovering some barriers weren't meant to be crossed.

Time would tell.

If time still meant anything when you'd folded it into geometries that broke human perception.
