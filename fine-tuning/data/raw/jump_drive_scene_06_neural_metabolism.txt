Dr. Aisha Mbara reviewed the cellular analysis and tried not to panic. Lieutenant Chen's neural tissue was dying. Not from trauma. From exhaustion.

"Metabolic stress markers are critical," she told the medical team. "Her neurons are consuming glucose at three times normal rate. Oxygen uptake is unsustainable. If we don't stabilize her metabolism, she'll suffer permanent brain damage within forty-eight hours."

"What's causing the increased consumption?" Dr. Marcus Webb asked.

"Temporal processing. Her restructured neural pathways are maintaining awareness across multiple timeframes simultaneously. The cognitive load is literally burning her brain out."

Aisha pulled up the progression charts. Jump one: Minor temporal perception. Jump five: Full temporal awareness. Jump seven: Consciousness fragmented across all moments.

Each jump had pushed Sarah further outside normal causality. Each adaptation had cost metabolic resources her body couldn't sustain.

"Can we reduce the temporal processing? Force her brain back to linear awareness?"

"I don't know. Her neural structure has physically changed. The temporal processing centers aren't additions—they've replaced normal hippocampal function. Shutting them down might eliminate consciousness entirely."

"So we have two options: Let her burn out experiencing all time simultaneously, or shut down her temporal centers and hope something remains?"

"Three options," Dr. Kenji Yamamoto said, entering the medical bay. "We find a way to sustain the temporal processing at reduced metabolic cost."

Aisha turned. "That's not medically possible. Neural activity requires energy. There's no way to think without consuming resources."

"Not in normal brains. But Sarah's brain isn't normal anymore." Kenji pulled up the neural scans. "Her temporal processing centers show structures similar to quantum computing architectures. What if we can provide external power support?"

"Neural tissue can't interface with external power sources."

"It can if we use the same techniques that created her temporal perception in the first place. The Alcubierre field affected her neurons during jump transition. What if we use controlled field exposure to energize her neural tissue directly?"

Marcus was shaking his head. "That's insane. Alcubierre fields warp spacetime. Exposing brain tissue to that would cause catastrophic damage."

"It already caused catastrophic restructuring. She survived. Adapted. What if we use micro-fields, precisely controlled, to provide energy directly to her temporal processing centers?"

Aisha ran the calculations. "The field strength would have to be incredibly precise. Too weak and it does nothing. Too strong and we compress her neural tissue into quantum paste."

"But theoretically possible?"

"Theoretically, gravity drives and FTL travel were impossible three years ago." Aisha highlighted the critical neural centers. "If we could generate micro-Alcubierre fields focused on her temporal processing regions, they might provide external energy support. But we'd need real-time monitoring and adaptive field control."

"I can build that," Kenji said. "Give me twelve hours."

"You have six. After that, cellular damage becomes irreversible."

Kenji left at a run. Aisha turned back to Sarah's unconscious form and wondered if they were saving her or torturing her.

Sarah existed across all moments. Aware of her past, present, future simultaneously. Unable to focus on any single moment long enough to act.

Was that consciousness or prison?

Did it matter if they couldn't bring her back?

Aisha checked the glucose drip. Sarah's body was consuming everything they could provide, but it wasn't enough. Her brain was literally eating itself to maintain temporal omniscience.

"Dr. Mbara," Marcus said quietly, "what if we can't save her?"

"Then we document everything. Make sure future test pilots understand the full risks." Aisha pulled up Sarah's pre-jump medical files. Healthy, brilliant, dedicated. A person who'd volunteered to push humanity's boundaries.

Now a person trapped outside linear time.

Five hours later, Kenji returned with a device that looked like a medical scanner crossed with a particle accelerator.

"Micro-Alcubierre field generator. Focused beam, variable intensity, real-time neural feedback control. It should provide external energy to her temporal processing centers."

"Should?"

"I've tested it on neural tissue samples. They showed increased metabolic stability under controlled field exposure."

"Dead tissue samples or living?"

"Dead. Obviously. I couldn't exactly experiment on living brains."

"Except now you are."

"Except now it's this or watch Sarah die from neural exhaustion." Kenji positioned the device around Sarah's head. "The field generator will pulse at frequencies matching her temporal processing rhythms. If this works, her neurons should absorb energy directly from spacetime distortion."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we've eliminated one option and moved on to the next. But I think it will work. Sarah's brain adapted to Alcubierre fields during jump transitions. This is just controlled, sustained exposure."

Aisha checked Sarah's vitals. Heart rate elevated. Blood pressure dropping. Cellular stress markers critical.

"Do it."

Kenji activated the micro-field generator. The air around Sarah's head shimmered slightly—barely visible distortion as spacetime bent on microscopic scales.

Sarah's neural monitors jumped.

"Activity spike in temporal processing centers," Marcus reported. "Metabolic indicators stabilizing. She's absorbing energy from the field."

Aisha watched the readouts. Glucose consumption dropping. Oxygen uptake normalizing. Neural stress markers improving.

"It's working. Her brain is using the Alcubierre field as an external power source."

"More than that," Kenji said. "Look at the coherence patterns. Her temporal consciousness is consolidating. She's focusing on the present moment."

Sarah's eyes opened.

Not completely. Not fully present. But aware enough to track movement, to process visual input.

"Sarah, can you hear me?" Aisha moved into her field of view.

Sarah's mouth moved. Sound emerged. "I hear you. Heard you. Will hear you. All simultaneously."

"Your temporal perception is still fragmented."

"Always will be. Can't unlearn experiencing all time at once." Sarah's voice was distant but present. "But the field is helping. Giving me energy to focus. To choose which moment to interact with."

"How do you feel?"

"Like I'm burning from the inside out while being frozen in the void while being perfectly comfortable. All true. All now." Sarah's eyes focused slightly. "Did the jump work? Did we solve the drift?"

"Perfect navigation. Zero error." Kenji pulled up the data. "Your neural-temporal interface technique corrected the field collapse."

"Good. Worth it then."

"Sarah, you nearly died. Your brain restructured itself trying to maintain temporal omniscience. We have you on life support using exotic physics."

"Still worth it. Humanity needed FTL. Someone had to pay the price." Sarah's expression flickered between moments—smiling, sad, determined, resigned. "I'm not who I was. But I'm still here. Still useful."

Aisha felt her throat tighten. "What do you remember? About before the jumps?"

"Everything. My childhood, my training, my family, my death in forty-seven years. All equally vivid. All equally present."

"You remember your future?"

"I remember probable futures. Quantum superposition of possibilities. The field lets me perceive temporal probability waves directly." Sarah tried to sit up. The micro-Alcubierre generator moved with her, maintaining field exposure. "How long can I sustain this?"

Kenji checked the power readings. "The generator can run indefinitely. But you'll need to stay within its field radius. Maybe three meters. Leave that range and your temporal processing loses external power support."

"So I'm tethered to exotic physics equipment for the rest of my life."

"Yes."

Sarah laughed. It sounded like three different laughs at different times. "Could be worse. Could be dead. Could have failed. Could have never volunteered."

"Could have lived a normal life," Aisha said quietly.

"Normal is overrated. I've seen the future, Aisha. Multiple futures. Humanity reaches the stars. Colonizes distant worlds. Builds civilization across the galaxy. All because we solved FTL navigation."

"Was it worth this?"

Sarah met her eyes. In that moment, she seemed perfectly present. Perfectly aware. Perfectly human.

"Ask me in forty-seven years. When I die. I'll tell you if it was worth it."

"You said you remember your death."

"Probable death. Future isn't fixed. Multiple timelines. I could die tomorrow or live to a hundred. I perceive the probabilities, not certainties."

Marcus pulled up the micro-field specifications. "We'll need to miniaturize this. Make it portable. You can't stay in the medical bay forever."

"Build me a backpack version. I can be the first temporal consciousness on permanent Alcubierre support." Sarah closed her eyes. "I'm tired. Existing in all moments is exhausting even with external power."

"Rest. We'll monitor your neural activity."

Sarah drifted toward something like sleep. Her consciousness scattered across time again, but anchored by the micro-field's energy support.

Aisha watched the monitors and wondered what they'd created.

A solution to FTL navigation. A technological breakthrough. A new form of human consciousness.

Or a cautionary tale about pushing too far, too fast.

Sarah Chen had volunteered to break the light barrier.

She'd succeeded.

Cost: Everything she was.
Gain: Everything humanity could become.

The math was brutal.

But the future was infinite.

And Sarah would experience every moment of it.

All at once.

Forever.
