Admiral Kowalski reviewed the jump test data with growing concern.

Seventeen jumps. Thirteen seconds of cumulative temporal drift. And Dr. Yamamoto's recommendation to suspend testing.

The program was behind schedule. Corporate partners were demanding results. Political pressure mounted daily.

But the data was clear. Jump drives stole time from pilots. Maybe worse than time. Maybe consciousness itself.

He pulled up Lieutenant Chen's medical records. Healthy. Alert. No obvious cognitive impairment.

Except for the gaps. Moments of her life missing. Holes in continuous awareness.

Kowalski had commanded ships for thirty years. He'd sent people into danger. Lost crew to equipment failures and combat. Made decisions that cost lives.

But this was different. This was asking someone to voluntarily fragment their own consciousness for experimental technology.

Dr. Mbara entered his office without knocking. The medical director looked tired.

"Admiral, we need to talk about Sarah."

"She's cleared for duty."

"She's cleared for normal duty. Jump testing is not normal duty." Mbara pulled up neural scans. "These consciousness gaps are accumulating. Not just in duration. In depth. Her brain is learning to skip moments. Adapting to quantum superposition by simply not processing it."

"Is that dangerous?"

"Unknown. The human brain is incredibly adaptable. But we're pushing into territory nobody's explored. What if her consciousness fragments permanently? What if she loses the ability to maintain coherent awareness?"

Kowalski studied the scans. Beautiful complexity. Billions of neurons. Patterns nobody fully understood.

"What's your recommendation?"

"Ground her. Immediately. Before we do irreversible damage."

"Dr. Yamamoto said fifty jumps before critical risk."

"That's theoretical. Based on models we're still developing. Sarah's brain might be more vulnerable. Or more resistant. We don't know." Mbara highlighted unusual patterns in the neural data. "Look at this. Her consciousness is already fragmenting. Not catastrophically. But measurably. Another fifty jumps could accelerate that beyond recovery."

Kowalski closed the files. "What does Lieutenant Chen say?"

"She wants to continue. Says the program is more important than her individual risk."

"And you disagree."

"I disagree with sacrificing someone for technology we might not need. There are alternatives. AI pilots. Automated systems. We don't have to use human consciousness."

"Human pilots are better. More adaptable. More creative under pressure."

"Human pilots also have rights. The right to informed consent includes the right to understand risks we don't fully comprehend." Mbara leaned forward. "Admiral, I'm asking you to ground Sarah. Not as a doctor. As someone who cares whether we're creating scientific advancement or human sacrifice."

Kowalski thought about his own career. Decisions made under pressure. Risks taken for strategic advantage.

How many of those decisions had he fully understood? How many had worked only because of luck?

"I'll talk to her," he said.

Sarah was in the pilot ready room, reviewing jump protocols. She looked up when he entered.

"Admiral."

"Lieutenant. At ease." Kowalski sat across from her. "I've reviewed your medical data. Dr. Mbara is concerned about consciousness fragmentation."

"I'm aware. But the program—"

"The program can wait. You can't. If we damage you permanently, the program loses its best pilot and I lose a valuable officer."

Sarah was quiet. Then: "What are you asking, Admiral?"

"I'm asking if you're sure. Not about the mission. About yourself. Whether you're willing to risk your mind for technology that might not work."

"The technology works. It's just expensive."

"In more ways than we anticipated." Kowalski pulled up the neural scans. "These gaps worry me, Sarah. We're changing your brain. Possibly permanently. For what? Faster travel? Commercial advantage?"

"For humanity's future among the stars. For exploration that's currently impossible." Sarah met his eyes. "Admiral, my grandparents were explorers. Pushed boundaries on Earth. They died doing what mattered to them. I'd rather die pushing humanity forward than live safely doing nothing."

"Noble. Also potentially misguided."

"Maybe. But it's my choice to make."

Kowalski knew that tone. The certainty of someone who'd made peace with consequences.

"Forty-eight hours," he said. "No jumps. You take medical leave. Rest. Let Dr. Mbara run comprehensive evaluations. If you're still cleared after that, we'll discuss next steps."

"Admiral—"

"That's an order, Lieutenant. You're grounded for forty-eight hours."

Sarah nodded stiffly. "Yes, sir."

She left. Kowalski sat alone in the ready room, wondering if he'd just saved her life or delayed inevitable sacrifice.

The jump program would continue. With or without Sarah. The political pressure was too strong. The corporate interests too invested.

But maybe, just maybe, forty-eight hours would give her clarity. Or give him courage to shut down testing before the program consumed another pilot.

He pulled up the program timeline. Adjusted schedules. Postponed demonstrations.

Buying time. Like everyone in this business. Buying time and hoping it was enough.

The next day, Kowalski received a message from Dr. Yamamoto.

*Admiral, I've identified a potential solution to temporal drift. Requesting meeting to discuss.*

They met in the engineering lab. Yamamoto looked excited. Dangerous sign in a physicist.

"Show me," Kowalski said.

Yamamoto pulled up quantum field equations. Complex mathematics Kowalski barely followed.

"The consciousness gaps occur at the boundary between the Alcubierre bubble and realspace. What if we expand the bubble? Make the boundary further from the pilot's position?"

"Wouldn't that require more energy?"

"Yes. Approximately thirty percent more. But the pilot would be deeper in the bubble. More isolated from quantum superposition effects."

"Would that eliminate temporal drift?"

"No. But it might reduce it. Maybe by half. Maybe more." Yamamoto pulled up simulations. "The pilot would still lose time. But less time. And consciousness fragmentation might be minimal."

Kowalski studied the models. "This is theoretical."

"Everything about jump drives is theoretical until we test it."

"And you want to test it on Lieutenant Chen."

"I want to test it on someone. Sarah's the most experienced. She understands the risks better than anyone."

Kowalski thought about Sarah's determination. Her family history of exploration. Her willingness to sacrifice for progress.

"If we do this—if we run the modified test—and it works, we present it to corporate partners as solved problem. Reduced risk. Acceptable drift levels."

"Exactly."

"And if it fails? If Sarah experiences worse fragmentation?"

"Then we shut down human jump testing permanently. Move to AI pilots exclusively."

Kowalski made his decision. "Get Sarah. Explain the modification. If she consents, we run one test. Modified bubble. Full monitoring. And regardless of outcome, we use the data to determine program viability."

"Agreed."

Sarah arrived an hour later. She'd rested. Looked clearer. More focused.

Yamamoto explained the modification. The expanded bubble. The theoretical reduction in drift.

"When do we test?" Sarah asked.

"Tomorrow. If you're still willing."

She didn't hesitate. "I'm willing. Let's prove this technology works."

Kowalski watched her leave with Yamamoto. Young. Determined. Possibly about to sacrifice pieces of her consciousness for human advancement.

He'd given orders that cost lives. But this felt different. This felt like asking someone to die slowly. One moment at a time.

Across tiny increments nobody would notice until suddenly, critically, they did.

He pulled up the program budget. The political demands. The corporate pressure.

All of it meaningless compared to one pilot's consciousness.

But he'd approved the test anyway. Because progress demanded sacrifice. Always had. Always would.

Tomorrow, they'd find out if the sacrifice was worth making.

Or if they were destroying something irreplaceable for marginal gain.

Either way, the jump program would advance.

That was his job. Moving humanity forward.

Even when forward meant through darkness nobody fully understood.
