Rafael stood in the ship's lab, comparing his field notes to Ling's atmospheric data. Two weeks of medical recovery had given him perspective. And doubt.

"Computer, overlay my biological survey observations with atmospheric contamination levels."

The correlation was immediate. Sites where he'd documented the most "remarkable" silicon photosynthesizer behaviors corresponded exactly with the highest neurotoxin concentrations.

Which meant his most enthusiastic observations had occurred while his brain was being chemically altered.

"Computer, flag observations made at contamination levels exceeding point-seven micrograms per cubic meter."

Forty-three percent of his observations flagged.

Nearly half his fieldwork was potentially compromised by dopamine-induced pattern recognition enhancement.

Rafael pulled up specific examples. His notes on "communication patterns" between silicon photosynthesizers. Observations of "coordinated bioluminescence" in the Crystal Forest. Documentation of "intentional" oxygen gradient creation around organism clusters.

Reading them now, with stable neurochemistry, they seemed... overenthusiastic. Seeing meaning where there might just be chemical coincidence.

"Damn it."

Priya entered the lab carrying her own tablet. "Reviewing your work?"

"Realizing how much of it was written while I was high on alien neurotoxins."

"Join the club. I thought I was making breakthrough discoveries about silicon-carbon hybrid molecules. Turns out I was just documenting obvious chemistry while my brain chemistry was anything but obvious."

Rafael pulled up the Crystal Forest observations. "Do you think any of it was real? Or was it all just dopamine-enhanced pattern recognition?"

Priya sat down and pulled up comparative analysis. "Some of it was real. The silicon-based photosynthesis is genuine. The dual biospheres are confirmed. The atmospheric oxygen production is measurable."

"But the more complex observations?"

"Need to be verified. Carefully. Without neurotoxin exposure influencing interpretation."

Rafael felt frustrated. Three weeks of survey work, and he couldn't trust half his conclusions.

"How do we separate valid observations from dopamine-induced fantasies?"

"Same way science always does. Peer review. Replication. Independent verification." Priya pulled up Ling's data. "Her atmospheric measurements are objective. Chemical analysis doesn't care about neurotransmitter levels. We use that as baseline and see what correlates."

Rafael ran the comparison. The silicon photosynthesizer distribution matched Ling's oxygen production maps. The dual biosphere evidence aligned with objective chemical signatures. The basic biology was sound.

But the complex behaviors he'd documented? Those were questionable.

"I thought I was observing ecosystem-level coordination. Now I think I was just seeing patterns that weren't there."

"Maybe. Or maybe you were seeing real patterns but over-interpreting their significance. Enhanced pattern recognition can be useful if you verify the patterns later."

Rafael pulled up the "coordinated bioluminescence" observations. The silicon photosynthesizers had pulsed light in what he'd described as "synchronized waves across the forest canopy."

"I described this as communication. But it could just be photochemical reactions responding to the same light stimulus."

"Could be. But it could also be actual coordination. The only way to know is to return with proper protection and document it objectively."

"Assuming Fleet approves a research station."

"Assuming that." Priya pulled up the contamination data. "But Rafael, even if half your observations turn out to be dopamine-enhanced over-interpretation, the other half is still revolutionary. You documented silicon-based photosynthesis in natural organisms. That alone is worth the entire mission."

Rafael wanted to believe that. Wanted to think his work had value beyond enthusiasm-driven speculation.

"How do you separate the good science from the compromised science when you can't trust your own observations?"

"You get collaborators to check your work. You run experiments. You admit uncertainty where uncertainty exists." Priya pulled up her own flagged observations. "I documented molecular interactions that I'm not sure were real or artifacts of altered perception. But I documented them. If someone repeats the experiments with proper controls, they'll know what to look for."

"That's... actually helpful. Failed hypotheses are still useful if they guide future research."

"Exactly. You don't need to be right about everything. You just need to document what you observed so others can verify or refute it."

Rafael pulled up his comprehensive biological survey. Hundreds of observations. Dozens of species documented. Biochemical pathways cataloged.

Some of it questionable. But much of it solid.

"I'm going to need to write a supplementary report. Flagging observations that might be compromised. Identifying what needs verification."

"We all are. Marcus is compiling a 'lessons learned' document for future survey teams. What precautions to take. What signs of neurotoxin exposure to watch for."

Rafael started drafting his supplementary analysis. Categorizing observations by confidence level. Flagging interpretations that required verification. Documenting the limitations of fieldwork conducted under biochemical impairment.

It was humbling. Admitting that his brain had been compromised while collecting data. That his judgments couldn't be fully trusted.

But it was honest. And science valued honesty over ego.

"Priya, do you think the second survey team will find anything different?"

"Depends on their precautions. If they use sealed environment suits and remote sampling from day one, they'll avoid the neurotoxin exposure. Their observations will be more objective."

"And more limited. They won't have the same direct contact with the ecosystem we had."

"That's the trade-off. Objectivity versus immersion. Safety versus insight."

Rafael thought about walking through the Crystal Forest. The sensation of being surrounded by alien life. The beauty of translucent trees glowing with bioluminescent light.

He'd been poisoning himself. But he'd also experienced something few humans ever would—direct contact with life that evolved independently from Earth.

"I don't regret it," he said. "Even knowing what it did to my brain chemistry, I don't regret the survey."

"That's the dopamine talking."

"Maybe. Or maybe it's recognition that some experiences are worth the risk."

Priya smiled slightly. "That definitely sounds like residual dopamine. Check back in another week when your neurochemistry is fully stabilized."

Rafael pulled up the final image from his survey—the Crystal Forest at sunset, twin suns painting the sky in amber and gold, silicon photosynthesizers converting light to oxygen through semiconductor reactions.

Compromised observations or not, that beauty was real.

The danger was real too. But so was the wonder.

"I'm putting in a request for the research station team," Rafael said. "If Fleet approves it, I want to go back."

"With proper protection this time?"

"With proper protection. Remote sampling. Objective measurements. All the caution we should have used the first time."

"And if Fleet doesn't approve the research station?"

"Then I'll write papers from the data we collected. Contribute to the field remotely. Find another way to understand what we discovered."

Priya pulled up her own research station application. "I'm requesting assignment too. We started this survey. We should be part of understanding what we found."

Rafael felt gratitude. His team hadn't just survived Kepler-442d. They'd learned from it. And they were willing to return, better prepared, to continue the work.

"Computer, compile my supplementary analysis. Flag all observations requiring verification. Cross-reference with team member contamination levels at time of documentation."

The report compiled. Forty-three percent flagged. Fifty-seven percent considered reliable.

More than half his work stood up to scrutiny. The rest provided hypotheses for future testing.

Not perfect. But honest. And in science, honesty mattered more than perfection.

Rafael finalized the supplementary report and submitted it to Marcus's compilation.

Another piece of the Kepler-442d assessment. Another admission that human judgment could be compromised by alien biochemistry.

Another lesson learned about the challenges of exoplanet survey work.

The second team would benefit from these lessons. Would know to watch for neurotoxin exposure. Would understand that beautiful environments could alter perception.

Would approach Kepler-442d with the caution Rafael's team should have used from the start.

Rafael pulled up the next survey target. Kepler-452b. Another world. Another chance to apply lessons learned.

Another opportunity to encounter alien life without letting it alter his brain chemistry.

He hoped.

Because the universe was full of wonders. And some of those wonders were worth the risk of discovery.

Even when discovery came with a price measured in compromised observations and dopamine disruption.

Rafael closed the supplementary report and started preparing for Kepler-452b.

Next time, they'd be more careful. More objective. More aware of the risks.

But they'd still explore. Still document. Still try to understand life in all its diverse and dangerous forms.

Because that was what survey teams did. They pushed boundaries. They took calculated risks. They brought back knowledge that expanded humanity's understanding.

Even when that knowledge came with asterisks and caveats and admissions of compromised judgment.

Science wasn't about being perfect. It was about being honest.

And Rafael could live with that.
