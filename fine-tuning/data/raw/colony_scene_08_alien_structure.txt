Dr. Omar Hassan's drill penetrated thirty-seven meters of Martian regolith before it hit something that shouldn't exist.

The drill bit stopped. Not jammed, not broken. Just stopped, like it had reached something harder than bedrock.

"Power's good," Jennifer Park said from the control station. "Torque is nominal. But we're not advancing."

Omar checked the drill telemetry. The bit was rated to penetrate solid basalt. It had chewed through Mars's crust without problem for thirty-seven meters. Now it was spinning against something that wouldn't yield.

"Pull the bit. Let's see what we hit."

The extraction took twenty minutes. When the drill core emerged, Omar stared at the sample with growing disbelief.

The last ten centimeters weren't rock.

"That's metal," Jennifer said.

"Alloy of some kind. Definitely not natural formation." Omar ran his gloved hand over the surface. Smooth, seamless, showing no sign of corrosion despite what should have been millions of years of exposure to Martian chemistry.

He carried the sample to the lab and placed it under the spectrometer. The analysis took five minutes that felt like five hours.

"Titanium-tungsten composite," Jennifer read from the display. "Ninety-three percent purity. Trace elements of... I don't even know what some of these are."

Omar pulled up the comparative database. The alloy composition didn't match anything in current industrial use. The molecular structure suggested manufacturing techniques that didn't exist in any catalog he had access to.

"This was made," he said. "Deliberately engineered."

"By who?"

"That's the question." Omar ran a crystallography scan. "The metallurgy is advanced. Really advanced. Look at the grain structure—it's perfect. No flaws, no impurities. This wasn't smelted using conventional techniques."

Jennifer pulled up the drill logs. "We're thirty-seven meters down, directly above one of the geometric voids from your magnetic resonance scan. You think this is part of whatever created those structures?"

"I think we just drilled into a roof." Omar examined the core sample. "If this is structural material, and it's sitting above hollow spaces, then we're looking at deliberate construction. Chambers. Possibly habitable spaces."

"On Mars?"

"Under Mars." He pulled up the magnetic resonance data, overlaying it with the drill location. "The geometric voids extend for hundreds of meters. If they're all connected, we're talking about a significant underground complex."

"How old?"

Omar ran an isotopic dating scan. The results were impossible.

"According to this, the alloy was manufactured approximately one-point-three billion years ago."

Jennifer stared at the data. "That's—"

"Impossible, yes. Mars had no indigenous life. No industrial civilization. No explanation for artificial structures that predate human evolution by a billion years." Omar saved the analysis and locked it with encryption. "And yet here's a piece of manufactured metal that says otherwise."

They stood in silence, looking at a core sample that rewrote everything they thought they knew about planetary history.

"We need to go deeper," Jennifer said.

"We need to know what we're getting into first." Omar pulled up the structural scans. "If this is a roof, it might be load-bearing. Drilling through could destabilize the chamber beneath."

"Or give us access."

"Or collapse it entirely." He examined the metal's properties. "The alloy is strong, but it's been underground for over a billion years. Structural integrity could be compromised."

Jennifer pulled up the drilling specifications. "We could use ground-penetrating radar first. Map the chamber from above, determine if it's safe to breach."

"That would take days. And it would create records in the colony system."

"You want to keep this quiet?"

Omar thought about it. A billion-year-old artificial structure beneath Mars Colony One. The scientific implications were staggering. The political implications were terrifying.

"Until we know more, yes. If this gets out before we can verify it, we'll have corporate shutting down operations, Earth sending investigation teams, media turning this into a circus."

"And if it's dangerous? If there's something down there that's a threat to the colony?"

"Then we handle it. Quietly. Professionally. But we verify first." Omar sealed the core sample in a containment case. "I need forty-eight hours to run every analysis I can think of. Materials science, structural engineering, hazard assessment. If the chamber is stable and safe, we figure out next steps. If it's not—"

"We collapse it and bury this forever?"

"We make sure the colony is safe. Science comes second to survival."

Jennifer nodded slowly. "What do you need from me?"

"Run the ground-penetrating radar overnight. Full scan of the area above the chamber. Look for structural weaknesses, stress points, anything that suggests instability. And keep the data encrypted."

"Done."

Omar took the core sample to his quarters—a violation of protocol, but he wasn't leaving billion-year-old alien alloy in a public lab overnight. He ran every test he could think of. Tensile strength, thermal conductivity, electromagnetic properties, radiation resistance.

Every test confirmed the same thing: this was manufactured using techniques that exceeded current human capabilities. The alloy was stronger, lighter, more resistant to environmental degradation than anything Earth's materials science could produce.

Someone had built this a billion years ago, and it was still structurally sound.

The implications were overwhelming. If there was an underground complex beneath the colony, if it was intact after a billion years, if there was any chance at all that something inside had survived—

Omar stopped that line of thinking. Focus on the science. The measurable. The verifiable.

He pulled up the magnetic resonance scans again, studying the geometry of the voids. They were regular, symmetric, suggesting intentional design. Chambers connected by corridors, structured in patterns that looked almost familiar.

Almost like a facility.

A research station. Or a habitat. Or something else entirely, built by intelligence that had existed on Mars when Earth was populated by primitive single-celled organisms.

Omar's hands were shaking. He forced himself to breathe, to think clearly.

Protocol said he should report this to Commander Rivera immediately. But protocol was written for normal situations. Broken equipment, geological hazards, resource management.

Not for finding evidence of extinct alien civilization beneath a human colony.

He composed a preliminary report, clinical and factual. Subsurface anomaly detected at thirty-seven meters. Artificial material recovered. Requesting authorization for expanded investigation.

He didn't mention the age. Didn't mention the implications. Didn't mention that everything humanity thought it knew about Mars was wrong.

Not yet.

First, he needed more data. More proof. More understanding of what they'd found and what it meant.

Then they could figure out what to do about living on top of a billion-year-old mystery that might not want to stay buried.
