Dr. Ling Zhang ran the final atmospheric simulation for the third time. The results confirmed what she'd suspected—Kepler-442d's oxygen levels were increasing. Not slowly. Fast enough to matter on human timescales.

"Computer, project oxygen concentration forward one hundred years."

The simulation ran. In a century, atmospheric oxygen could reach forty-five percent. Maybe fifty percent in two centuries.

High enough to make the entire planet a fire hazard.

She pulled up combustion modeling. Any spark in that environment would trigger conflagration. Lightning storms would cause wildfires that consumed continents. The crystalline forests Rafael documented would burn like thermite.

"Marcus, we have another problem."

Five minutes later, Marcus was reviewing her projections. "You're saying the planet is actively becoming less habitable?"

"I'm saying it's in transition. The silicon photosynthesizers are oxygenating the atmosphere faster than geological processes can balance. Eventually, something will equilibrate—either the oxygen production will slow, or some other chemical process will consume the excess. But right now, the planet is heading toward atmospheric conditions that would be catastrophic."

Marcus pulled up geological records. "What happened on Earth during high-oxygen periods?"

"Massive wildfires. Giant insects because arthropods can support larger body sizes in high-oxygen atmospheres. Complete restructuring of ecosystems. And eventually, a crash when something disrupted the oxygen production or a major extinction event reset the balance."

"How long until Kepler-442d reaches critical oxygen levels?"

"If current trends continue? Maybe five hundred years. A thousand at most."

Marcus was quiet. "That's... actually a long time."

"On human timescales, yes. On geological timescales, it's instantaneous. We're witnessing a planet in the middle of a major atmospheric transition."

"Which makes long-term colonization planning impossible. Even if we solved the biochemical compatibility issues, we'd be establishing colonies on a world where atmospheric conditions could change radically within a few generations."

Ling pulled up Earth's atmospheric history. "Our planet went through similar transitions. The Great Oxygenation Event, two-point-four billion years ago. Photosynthetic life started producing oxygen, the atmosphere changed, and most anaerobic life went extinct. It was the biggest extinction event Earth ever experienced."

"And we might be watching the same thing happen on Kepler-442d."

"Except compressed into a much shorter timeframe. Earth's oxygenation took hundreds of millions of years. Kepler-442d might complete the transition in thousands."

Marcus pulled up the colonization assessment. Another complication. Another reason to recommend against permanent settlement.

"Could we slow it? Intervene somehow to stabilize atmospheric oxygen levels?"

"How? The silicon photosynthesizers are planet-wide. We'd need to reduce their population by orders of magnitude. That's ecosystem engineering on a scale humanity's never attempted."

"Terraforming."

"Reverse terraforming. Making a planet less suitable for oxygen-producing life." Ling pulled up ecological models. "And we don't know what consequences that would have. The silicon photosynthesizers are the base of the food chain. Reduce their numbers significantly, and everything that depends on them suffers."

"Everything except humans."

"Humans who'd be responsible for triggering an extinction event on an alien world. The ethics of that are... complicated."

Marcus stared at the atmospheric projections. Rising oxygen. Increasing fire risk. A planet transforming itself in geological real-time.

"Add it to the report. Another factor making colonization impossible."

After Marcus left, Ling returned to her simulations. She ran scenarios where oxygen production slowed. Where geological processes consumed more oxygen. Where some undiscovered mechanism brought the system into balance.

None of the scenarios looked good for colonization.

But they were fascinating from a scientific perspective.

She was watching a planet evolve. Seeing atmospheric chemistry change in ways Earth had experienced billions of years ago. Witnessing an oxygenation event compressed into human-observable timescales.

This was the kind of data that planetary scientists dreamed about.

And it was evidence that Kepler-442d was fundamentally unsuitable for long-term human habitation.

Ling started drafting an addendum to her atmospheric analysis. The oxygen increase. The fire risk projections. The comparison to Earth's Great Oxygenation Event.

Every paragraph made Kepler-442d more scientifically valuable and less colonizable.

She thought about the silicon photosynthesizers. Organisms so efficient at producing oxygen they were changing their planet's atmosphere. Not intentionally. Not with purpose. Just by existing, by reproducing, by converting sunlight into chemical energy through semiconductor reactions.

They were successful. Too successful. And their success was transforming their world in ways that might eventually destroy them.

Unless something changed. Unless evolution found a balance. Unless the planet's systems adapted to accommodate the excess oxygen.

Ling pulled up images from the Crystal Forest. Beautiful translucent structures spreading across the landscape. Organisms that had solved the problem of photosynthesis in ways Earth never considered.

And in solving that problem, they'd created a new one—too much oxygen.

She wondered if they'd survive their own success. If Kepler-442d would find equilibrium or spiral into atmospheric extremes that sterilized the surface.

Humanity wouldn't be around to watch. Not as colonists. Maybe as researchers, observing from orbital stations or sealed habitats, documenting how a planet transformed itself.

But they wouldn't call it home.

Ling finalized her addendum and attached it to the growing colonization assessment. Each team member adding their piece. Each analysis pointing to the same conclusion.

Kepler-442d was magnificent. Scientifically invaluable. Evolving in real-time.

And absolutely unsuitable for human colonization.

She pulled up the next survey target and started preliminary analysis. Another planet. Another hope. Another possibility that would probably reveal complications once they got close enough to examine properly.

Finding Earth-like worlds was easy. Telescopes had cataloged thousands.

Finding worlds where humans could actually survive long-term? That was proving much harder.

Ling ran atmospheric models for Kepler-452b, their next destination. The preliminary data looked promising. Earth-standard gravity. Stable atmospheric composition. No obvious red flags.

But Kepler-442d had looked promising too. Until they landed and started breathing neurotoxins.

Until they discovered dual biospheres and silicon-based photosynthesis.

Until they realized the planet was oxygenating itself toward catastrophic atmospheric conditions.

Ling made notes for the next survey. Additional precautions. More extensive atmospheric testing before landing. Biological contamination protocols from the start.

Learning from Kepler-442d's lessons. Using the knowledge they'd gained to be more careful next time.

Because the universe was teaching them humility. Showing them that Earth-like wasn't enough. That habitability required more than matching gravity and temperature.

It required chemistry that aligned with human biology. Ecosystems that had reached stable equilibrium. Atmospheric conditions that wouldn't poison or burn them.

Finding all of that in one place? That was the real challenge.

Ling pulled up the colonist ship trajectories. Thousands of people traveling through the void, hoping survey teams would find them a home.

She wanted to give them that. Wanted to find a planet where humanity could thrive instead of just survive.

But she wouldn't lie about the risks. Wouldn't recommend colonization just to meet expectations.

Science demanded honesty. Even when that honesty meant disappointing thousands of people.

Ling finalized her atmospheric analysis and submitted it to the growing report.

Another piece of the puzzle. Another reason Kepler-442d wasn't home.

Another step toward understanding what humanity really needed to survive beyond Earth.

The data was clear. The conclusions were sound.

Now they just had to find a planet that met all the requirements.

And hope the colonists could wait long enough for them to succeed.
