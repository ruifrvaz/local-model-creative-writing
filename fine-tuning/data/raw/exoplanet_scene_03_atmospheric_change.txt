Dr. Ling Zhang found the atmospheric anomaly during routine monitoring. Oxygen isotope ratios were shifting in the valley ecosystem where the XCOs had established their colony.

Not dramatically. Point-zero-three percent variation. But measurable. Significant.

She ran additional tests. Nitrogen composition. Carbon dioxide levels. Trace gas analysis.

Everything was changing. Subtly. Consistently.

"The XCOs are modifying the atmosphere," she reported at the weekly science briefing.

Priya looked up from her notes. "Define modifying."

"They're processing gases. Taking in one composition, releasing another. Like photosynthesis but different chemical pathways." Ling displayed her data. "The oxygen isotope shift suggests they're preferentially metabolizing O-16 over O-18. That changes the atmospheric signature."

"How much atmosphere are we talking about?"

"Currently? The valley ecosystem. Maybe a cubic kilometer of air. But the effect is measurable." Ling pulled up trend projections. "If the XCO population continues expanding, they could alter the entire planetary atmosphere over geological timescales."

Marcus considered the implications. "Are they terraforming the planet?"

"Not intentionally. Probably not. But their metabolic processes have atmospheric consequences. Just like Earth organisms did billions of years ago."

Rafael was excited. "This is the Great Oxygenation Event. We're watching it happen in real-time."

"On a much smaller scale," Priya cautioned. "Earth's atmosphere took hundreds of millions of years to transform. But yes, the principle is similar. Biological processes changing planetary chemistry."

"Should we stop them?" Marcus asked.

"Stop them how? And why?" Priya gestured at the monitoring data. "They're not harming our base camp. Not threatening our operations. They're just... existing. And their existence has chemical consequences."

"Consequences that could make this planet less habitable for humans in the long term."

"Or more habitable. We don't know the end state. The XCOs might be optimizing the atmosphere for their own biology. Which could be compatible with ours or could be toxic."

Ling ran long-term projections. "At current rates, significant atmospheric change would take fifty thousand years minimum. That's longer than human civilization has existed. Not exactly an immediate threat."

"But it establishes precedent. We're encountering alien life that actively modifies its environment. That has implications for every future colony world."

Priya made notes. "We need to document this comprehensively. Understand the metabolic pathways. Map the atmospheric impact. Build a model for how biological processes create planetary-scale change."

"That's years of research."

"Then we extend the mission. This is fundamental xenobiology. We can't just observe it and leave."

Marcus pulled up mission parameters. "We're authorized for two-year survey. Already at twenty-three months. Fleet Command wants us back for debriefing."

"Fleet Command can wait. This is more important than schedules." Priya met his eyes. "Marcus, we're watching a planet develop a biosphere. That doesn't happen on human timescales normally. If we leave now, we lose the chance to understand it."

"If we stay without authorization, we violate mission orders."

"Then request extension. Make the case that this research justifies continued presence."

Marcus drafted the request that evening. Comprehensive documentation of XCO atmospheric effects. Argument for extended observation. Request for two additional years.

Fleet Command's response came three weeks later. Denied. Return immediately for scheduled mission rotation.

"They don't understand the significance," Priya said, reading the rejection.

"Or they understand perfectly and don't care. Science takes second place to logistics." Marcus pulled up departure schedules. "We've got six weeks to wrap operations."

"Six weeks to document fifty thousand years of atmospheric evolution. That's not enough."

"It's what we have."

Priya spent the remaining time in obsessive data collection. Atmospheric samples. XCO metabolic analysis. Environmental monitoring across every accessible location.

Building a dataset that future researchers could analyze. Proof that this planet was developing active biosphere.

The last sample collection happened on departure day. Priya stood at the metal field where XCOs clustered in geometric arrays. Their crystalline structures glowed faintly in the alien sunset.

"We'll be back," she told them. Not that they could understand. Or care.

But she needed to say it.

The research vessel departed Kepler-186f carrying terabytes of data and unanswered questions.

Priya spent the return journey analyzing atmospheric models. The XCOs' metabolic processes were elegant—taking in carbon dioxide and trace minerals, releasing oxygen and complex organic compounds.

Almost like photosynthesis. But powered by chemical energy instead of light.

"They're chemosynthetic ecosystem engineers," she concluded in her final report. "Modifying their environment through metabolic byproducts. Given sufficient time and population, they could transform the entire planet."

"Into what?" Ling asked.

"Unknown. But probably something more biologically active than current state. They're adding complexity to a relatively simple planetary chemistry."

The research vessel docked at orbital station six months after leaving Kepler-186f. Priya presented her findings to the scientific review board.

Their response was tepid. Interesting but not urgent. Recommended for future study but not prioritized funding.

"They don't get it," Rafael said after the presentation. "We showed them alien terraforming and they filed it under 'interesting observations.'"

"Because it happens on timescales beyond human planning. Fifty thousand years means nothing to administrators focused on quarterly objectives." Priya archived her data. "But the research exists. Future scientists will have access."

"Think anyone will go back?"

"Eventually. When we're ready to understand what we saw." Priya pulled up the XCO images. Geometric and alien and alive. "They're still there. Still modifying their planet. Still being what they are."

"Building something we can't predict."

"Exactly. And that's wonderful."

Marcus joined them in the observation deck. "Fleet approved a follow-up survey. In twenty years."

"Twenty years?" Rafael looked dismayed. "The XCOs could spread across the entire planet by then."

"Or they could stabilize at equilibrium. Or die off from unknown factors. We don't know." Marcus smiled slightly. "But in twenty years, we'll find out."

"Will we be on the mission?" Priya asked.

"If we want to be. Fleet is building a permanent research presence. Rotating teams. Long-term observation."

"Permanent presence means colony infrastructure. We'd be changing the planet ourselves."

"Human impacts versus XCO impacts. Different scales. Different mechanisms. But yes, we'd be another factor in the planetary evolution."

Priya considered. Twenty years. She'd be older. Less mobile. But still capable of research.

And the XCOs would be there. Doing what they'd done for geological ages.

"I'm in," she said. "For the follow-up. I want to see what they've built."

"Me too," Rafael agreed.

Ling nodded. "Someone needs to maintain observational continuity. Might as well be us."

Marcus made the notation. "Twenty years. Kepler-186f redux. We'll see what mysteries are waiting."

Priya looked at the star charts. Kepler-186f was fifteen light-years away. The XCOs were there now. Processing atmosphere. Building complexity. Transforming their world.

Humanity would return. Eventually.

To learn. To understand. To witness.

The universe was patient.

So were its students.

Twenty years.

She could wait.
