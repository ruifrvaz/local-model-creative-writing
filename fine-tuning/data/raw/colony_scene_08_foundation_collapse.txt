Alexis Kwan stood at the edge of the newly discovered void, staring into darkness.

The ground had collapsed overnight. Module A's foundation now hung over a cavity fifteen meters deep and growing.

Dr. Omar Hassan pointed his scanner into the void. "It's expanding. Half a meter per hour. At this rate, it'll undermine the entire habitat within forty-eight hours."

"Can we evacuate?"

"To where? The emergency shelters can hold us for maybe a week. Then we'd have to abandon Mars entirely."

"What caused this?"

Omar pulled up seismic data. "The ice we've been extracting for water. It wasn't just sitting in pockets. It was part of a structural network. Removing it destabilized everything."

"So we caused this."

"We caused it by following protocols designed for Earth geology. Mars doesn't follow those rules."

Alexis pulled up structural schematics. "Can we reinforce the foundation? Pump support materials into the void?"

"With what? Our concrete supply is limited. The void is massive. We'd use everything we have and still not fill it."

"Then we shore up the critical sections. Abandon what we can't save."

"That's half the habitat. Where do forty-three people live when we cut our space in half?"

Alexis didn't have an answer. The colony was already cramped. Cutting it further meant impossible crowding. Increased conflict. Reduced functionality.

"We need help," she said. "Earth. Olympus. Anyone."

"Help is months away. We don't have months."

Commander Rivera joined them at the void edge. She looked tired. Older than her years.

"Options?" she asked.

"Bad and worse," Alexis said. "We can try to reinforce what we have. Or we abandon the surface and retreat to the emergency bunker."

"Which isn't designed for long-term habitation."

"No. But it's deep. Stable. Not sitting on collapsing ground."

Rivera pulled up the bunker specs. Designed for dust storms. Radiation events. Short-term emergencies.

Not permanent living.

"How long could we survive in the bunker?"

"Three months. Maybe four with strict rationing." Alexis highlighted the resource limitations. "Then we'd need rescue or we'd die slowly."

"And reinforcement?"

"Might work. Might fail catastrophically. We're improvising solutions to problems we don't fully understand."

Rivera looked at the void. At the habitat. At the forty-three lives depending on her decisions.

"We reinforce. Use every resource we have. If it fails, we retreat to the bunker and call for evacuation."

"That's a lot of ifs, Commander."

"Everything about Mars is ifs. We knew that coming here." Rivera turned to Hassan. "Give me detailed analysis of the void's progression. Every measurement you can get. Alexis, start calculating reinforcement requirements."

They worked for eighteen hours straight. Hassan mapping the void's expansion. Alexis designing support structures from salvaged materials.

The void grew. Relentless. Patient. Hungry for the ground above.

Alexis designed a framework. Steel supports driven deep into bedrock below the void. Spanning the cavity. Distributing the habitat's weight across stable ground.

It was ambitious. Borderline impossible. But mathematically sound.

She presented it to Rivera. "It'll take every steel beam we have. Every structural support. We'll be cannibalizing other modules to save Module A."

"Do it. I'd rather have a smaller, stable habitat than a larger one that collapses."

The construction began immediately. Chen and his team working around the clock. Welding. Bolting. Reinforcing.

The void kept growing. Now twenty meters deep. Thirty. Approaching the limits of their planned supports.

"It's accelerating," Hassan reported. "Subsurface ice is melting faster. Maybe from the heat we're generating with construction."

"Can we stop it?"

"We can try cooling the area. Reduce thermal input. But that means stopping construction."

"Which we can't do. The framework has to be complete before the void reaches critical expansion."

Impossible equations. Competing requirements. Solutions that created new problems.

Malik worked the numbers obsessively. Calculating load distribution. Stress tolerances. Safety margins that kept shrinking.

On day three, one of the support beams cracked during installation. Metal fatigue accelerated by Martian temperature extremes.

Chen replaced it with salvaged material. Lower quality. Less reliable. But available.

On day five, the void's expansion slowed. Maybe from reduced thermal input. Maybe from random geology. Nobody knew.

They finished the framework on day seven. Exhausted. Running on stimulants and desperation.

Alexis ran final structural analysis. The numbers were marginal. Acceptable. Barely.

"It'll hold," she told Rivera. "Probably."

"Probably isn't a guarantee."

"Guarantees don't exist on Mars. We have probably. That's better than nothing."

They evacuated Module A temporarily. Transferred weight gradually to the new framework. Monitored for failure.

The supports held.

Day one. Day two. Day seven.

The void stopped expanding. Stabilized at thirty-seven meters deep. The framework distributed the habitat's load across bedrock. Stressed but functional.

They'd survived. Again.

But Alexis saw the cost. Modules B and C were stripped of structural components. The workshop was half its original size. The recreation dome was abandoned completely.

The colony was smaller. More cramped. More fragile.

"We can't keep doing this," she told Rivera privately.

"Doing what?"

"Sacrificing pieces of the colony to save other pieces. Eventually, there won't be anything left to sacrifice."

Rivera looked at the stripped modules. The abandoned sections. The shrinking safe zone.

"What do you suggest?"

"Admit we're failing. Call for evacuation. While we still can."

"You want to give up."

"I want to survive. There's a difference." Alexis pulled up resource projections. "We're running out of everything. Parts. Materials. Space. Solutions. Mars is grinding us down. Maybe it's time to accept we weren't ready for this."

Rivera was quiet for a long time. Then: "I'll draft the evacuation request. But Alexis, we don't transmit it unless conditions deteriorate further. This colony represents humanity's Mars presence. If we abandon it, we set back settlement by decades."

"Better set back than dead."

"Maybe. Or maybe we're stronger than we think. Maybe we can adapt."

"We've been adapting. It's exhausting."

"It's Mars. Exhausting is the baseline." Rivera pulled up the colony charter. "We volunteered for this. Knowing the risks. Knowing the hardships. I'm not ready to quit yet."

Alexis understood. The mission mattered. The symbolism mattered. Proving humanity could survive on Mars mattered.

But survival mattered more.

She returned to her quarters. Ran the numbers again. Looking for solutions that didn't exist.

Outside her window, Mars stretched eternal. Red and dead and utterly indifferent to human struggle.

Forty-three people. One damaged colony. Finite resources.

Against a planet that had killed every previous attempt to settle it.

The odds weren't good. Never had been.

But they were still alive. Still trying. Still refusing to let Mars claim them.

That had to count for something.

Even if Alexis wasn't sure what.
