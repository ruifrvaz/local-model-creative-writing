The education center buzzed with children's voices. Malik watched his daughter, Keiko, now seven years old, working on a structural engineering simulation. She'd inherited his analytical mind and Sofia's determination. Dangerous combination for a child growing up on a failing ship.

"Daddy, the simulation says the hull will fail." Keiko pointed at her screen. "But the ship is still flying. Why?"

Other parents would deflect. Give simple answers. Protect childhood innocence. Malik had decided years ago that honesty served children better than comfort.

"Because we constantly repair it. The hull wants to fail. Our job is to prevent that."

"Forever?"

"For as long as we need to reach Tau Ceti."

"That's my whole life. And my kids' lives. And their kids."

Seven years old and already understanding the generational burden. Malik felt pride and sadness in equal measure.

"Yes. That's the mission we inherited. And the mission you're inheriting."

Keiko returned to her simulation, adjusting variables, testing solutions. Around them, other children worked on various projects. Navigation calculations. Agricultural optimization. Medical diagnostics. The curriculum prepared children for ship roles from early ages.

Prepare. Not choose. That distinction troubled Malik more as Keiko grew older.

Dr. Chen Li-hua moved between the children, offering guidance. Ninety-one years old and still volunteering in education. She stopped beside Keiko's station.

"Good work. You're thinking about resource efficiency. That's advanced for your age."

"My dad says resources matter more than anything."

"Your dad is mostly right. But relationships matter too. A ship with perfect systems and broken community still fails."

Keiko considered this. "Can you fix both?"

"You can try. That's what your parents do. Maintain systems and relationships simultaneously."

After class, Malik walked Keiko back to their quarters. The corridors were warmer now—the reactor crisis resolved months ago. But other problems persisted. Always other problems.

"Am I going to be an engineer like you?" Keiko asked.

"Do you want to be?"

"I don't know if I get to want. You're an engineer. Grandpa was an engineer. The ship needs engineers."

Malik stopped walking. They were near the observation deck. He pulled Keiko to the viewport.

"What do you see?"

"Stars. Same as always."

"The ship sees resources to navigate around. I see distances to calculate. Your mother sees patterns to analyze. But what do you see?"

Keiko stared at the stars. "I see where we're going. Tau Ceti. The place I'll never reach but my kids might."

"And how does that make you feel?"

"Sad. And angry. I didn't choose this. I was born into it."

Honest. Painful. Exactly what Malik had feared and expected.

"You're right. You didn't choose. Neither did I. Neither did anyone born on this ship." Malik knelt to her level. "But now you get to choose how you respond. With resentment or purpose. With anger or dedication. With resistance or contribution."

"That's not fair. Adults chose the mission. We just inherited it."

"Life isn't fair. Space isn't fair. Physics doesn't care about fairness. We work with what exists, not what we wish existed."

Keiko's eyes filled with tears. "I want to go home. But we don't have a home. Just this ship. Forever."

Malik pulled her close. Seven years old. Already carrying the existential weight that defined ship life. No planetary surface. No escape. No alternative except the mission.

"The ship is home. The crew is family. The mission is purpose. Those aren't substitutes for Earth. They're what we've built instead."

"But I'll never see Earth. Never see a real planet. Never—" She sobbed against his shoulder. All the grief that came with understanding. The realization that her life was constrained by decisions made before she existed.

Malik let her cry. Sometimes grief needed expression before acceptance became possible.

Sofia found them an hour later, still on the observation deck. She sat beside Keiko, wrapped an arm around her daughter.

"Rough day?"

"I told her class about resource efficiency. She extrapolated to existential meaning." Malik tried to smile. Failed.

"She's seven. Maybe we should have waited a few years before the full truth."

"She asked directly. I won't lie to her."

Sofia pulled Keiko onto her lap. "Baby, I know this is hard. But you're part of something important. Something bigger than any individual life."

"I don't want to be important. I want to be normal."

"Normal is relative. Your normal is growing up on a generation ship. My normal was too. Grandma's normal was too. We adapt."

"Or we die," Keiko said quietly. "That's what Grandpa Chen said. Adapt or die. Space doesn't care which."

Malik and Sofia exchanged looks. Chen Li-hua had been teaching Keiko's class about ship history. Apparently not sugarcoating the lessons.

"Grandpa Chen is right," Malik said. "But adaptation isn't surrender. It's choosing how to thrive in difficult conditions. You're thriving, Keiko. You're smart, capable, curious. Those traits serve you regardless of circumstances."

"But I have to use them for the mission. I don't get to choose something different."

"You can choose roles within the mission framework. Engineering, medical, agriculture, education, culture. Lots of options."

"All on the ship. All serving the mission. No option to leave."

The truth hung between them. No escape. No alternative. Born on the ship, raised on the ship, would die on the ship. Keiko would never know planetary gravity, atmospheric weather, natural ecosystems. Just recycled air, synthetic food, and the constant hum of life support systems.

"I'm sorry," Malik said finally. "I'm sorry we brought you into this situation. Your mother and I knew what we were asking you to inherit. We decided to have you anyway because we believed the mission mattered. That belief might have been selfish."

Keiko looked up at him. "Do you regret having me?"

"Never. Not for a second. But I regret that your options are constrained by our choices."

"Everyone's options are constrained. That's what Grandpa Chen teaches. Earth people are constrained by gravity and weather and disease. We're constrained by ship systems and limited resources. Different constraints, same reality."

Seven years old. Already philosophical. Already accepting limitations that would crush some adults.

"You're very wise," Sofia said gently.

"I'm very trapped. Wisdom is what you call it when you can't change your situation."

They sat together on the observation deck, watching stars streak past. A family bound by blood and circumstance. Connected by love and resentment. Surviving because alternatives didn't exist.

Eventually Keiko fell asleep against Sofia's shoulder. Malik carried her back to their quarters, tucked her into her bunk, watched her breathe steadily in sleep.

"She's handling it better than I expected," Sofia whispered.

"She's seven. The full weight hasn't hit yet. Wait until she's a teenager and realizes she'll never have the freedoms her peers on Earth have."

"Earth peers she'll never meet and who might not exist anymore for all we know."

True. Earth was twelve light-years away and receding. No communication possible at this distance. Whatever happened there—wars, climate disasters, technological advancement—remained unknown to the ship. They were isolated temporally and spatially from origin and destination.

"Dr. Okoye wants to talk to us," Sofia said. "About Keiko's genetic screening results."

Malik felt ice in his chest. "When?"

"Tomorrow. He said it wasn't urgent but we should discuss it soon."

More genetic diversity issues. More hereditary risks. More consequences of limited population and degraded cryo banks.

"She seems healthy."

"For now. But you know the screening goes beyond immediate health. It's about long-term viability, reproduction risks, population-level impacts."

Malik did know. Every child born on the ship was screened extensively. Genetic markers identified, hereditary conditions cataloged, reproductive counseling provided. The medical system trying to manage diversity loss through knowledge and planning.

"Whatever Okoye says, we handle it together."

"Together," Sofia agreed.

They stood in their small quarters—eight meters square, same as every crew family's allocation. Keiko in her bunk, their entire life compressed into minimal space. This was normal. This was home. This was what they'd chosen when they decided to have a child.

"Do you regret it?" Sofia asked quietly. "Not having Keiko. But continuing the mission. Voting the way you did."

Malik had voted for diversion to HD 85512. Lost by forty-nine votes. Spent the last seven years implementing a mission he'd opposed.

"I regret that we're in this situation. I don't regret my vote. I believed then and believe now that diverting would have saved lives."

"But you're still here. Still working. Still dedicated to making this work."

"Because the alternative is watching everything collapse. My opinion about the best path doesn't override my responsibility to the crew."

Sofia moved to the viewport. Their quarters had a small observation window—luxury allocation for engineering leadership. Stars visible through composite materials engineered to last four hundred years.

"Keiko will be fine," Sofia said. "She's resilient. Adaptable. She'll find meaning in the mission eventually."

"Or she'll resent us for bringing her into it."

"Possibly both. Humans are complicated."

Malik joined her at the viewport. Held her hand. Watched the stars with his wife, his daughter asleep behind them, their future uncertain and constrained and precious despite everything.

"I love you," he said.

"I love you too. And I love our daughter. And I love this ridiculous impossible mission that's going to kill us all or make us legendary."

"Probably both."

"Definitely both."

They stood together in the darkness, sustained by systems designed by dead people, traveling toward a destination they'd never reach, raising a child who'd inherit burdens she didn't choose.

And somehow, impossibly, it felt meaningful.

Purpose extracted from constraint. Dignity claimed within limitation. Love expressed despite inevitable loss.

That was generation ship life. That was what they'd chosen. That was what Keiko would choose too, eventually, when she stopped resenting the inheritance and started accepting it.

Or maybe she'd find a third option. Something no generation before had considered. A way to transcend the binary of acceptance or resentment.

Malik hoped so. Hoped his daughter's generation would be wiser than his. Would find solutions where he'd seen only impossible choices.

That was the point of generational missions. Not just surviving. But evolving. Becoming something new through the journey. Something that could thrive in constraints. Something that chose meaning over comfort.

Keiko would be part of that. Would shape it. Would inherit it and transform it.

Malik just had to keep the ship together long enough for her generation to get their chance.

One day at a time. One repair at a time. One choice at a time.

Until they reached Tau Ceti. Or died trying. Or transcended the binary and found something else entirely.

He was betting on his daughter's generation to figure it out.

Because he'd run out of answers himself.

And that was okay. That was his role. Maintain the ship. Raise the next generation. Pass forward the responsibility. Trust that they'd be better equipped to handle what came next.

Faith, in the end. Not in the mission. But in the people who'd continue it.

His daughter. Her children. Their children.

The generations yet to come. The ones who'd either reach Tau Ceti or make that destination irrelevant by finding meaning in the journey itself.

Malik could live with that. Could die with that.

Could dedicate himself to it. One repair. One day. One generation at a time.
