The jump ship cockpit was cramped and sterile. Sarah Chen ran through pre-flight checks with mechanical precision, ignoring the neural sensors Dr. Mbara had attached to her skull.

"Alcubierre field generators online. Bubble stability at ninety-eight percent."

Dr. Kenji Yamamoto's voice came through the comm from mission control. "Neural monitoring active. We're reading your baseline. How do you feel?"

"Like I'm about to bend spacetime for the fifth time this month."

"That's not what I asked."

Sarah paused. Honest answer: terrified. Her brain still hadn't recovered from jump four. Time was still broken. But honesty wasn't what the mission needed.

"I'm ready."

"Sarah—"

"Let's not do this again, Kenji. We both know I'm going. The question is whether you're going to give me good data or waste time with concern."

Silence. Then: "Jump sequence initiating in sixty seconds."

The countdown began. Sarah watched the field generators spool up, felt the familiar tingle as exotic matter began warping local spacetime. The universe outside the viewport stretched, compressed, became something alien.

Her neural tissue remembered this. Four previous jumps. Four times experiencing causality as negotiable.

This would be the fifth.

Assuming she survived.

"Thirty seconds. Field coherence holding at ninety-nine percent."

Sarah gripped the control stick. Not that she could do anything once the jump started. The computer handled the field equations. She was just cargo. Highly trained, extensively monitored cargo.

"Fifteen seconds. Neural baseline stable."

The universe outside turned strange colors. Blue became red became something that didn't have a name. She'd asked Kenji what she was seeing. He'd said photons experiencing time dilation.

She'd asked what that meant for her retinas.

He'd changed the subject.

"Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One. Jump initiated."

Reality broke.

Sarah existed in three different moments simultaneously. She was in the cockpit. She was arriving at the target coordinates. She was still on the launch pad preparing for the jump.

All true. All happening. All now.

Her brain tried to process the contradiction. Failed. Continued anyway because stopping meant death.

The Alcubierre bubble enclosed the ship. Spacetime compressed ahead, expanded behind. They rode the resulting wave at ten times the speed of light.

Sarah's neural tissue experienced each microsecond differently.

Front of her skull: Future.
Back of her skull: Past.
Everything between: Confused.

She'd felt this before. Jump one had been surprising. Jump two, concerning. Jump three, frightening. Jump four, devastating.

Jump five was familiar.

That scared her more than the physics.

Her brain was adapting to temporal paradox. Learning to exist across multiple timestreams. Becoming something that experienced causality as fluid.

Human consciousness wasn't supposed to work this way.

The bubble held for three seconds. Three seconds at faster-than-light velocity. Three seconds where Sarah existed outside normal time.

Three seconds that felt like years and microseconds simultaneously.

Then collapse.

The field released asymmetrically. Front of the ship arrived first. Back of the ship followed nanoseconds later. The difference was tiny.

To her neurons, it was catastrophic.

Sarah felt her consciousness fragment. Past-Sarah and Future-Sarah occupied the same skull, experiencing different moments, trying to reconcile impossible information.

The neural sensors screamed.

"Catastrophic desync!" Dr. Mbara's voice, distant. "Sarah, can you hear me?"

Could she? Was hearing a past-tense or present-tense activity? Were the words arriving now or three seconds ago?

"Sarah, respond!"

She tried. Her mouth moved. Sound emerged. But the words felt wrong—like she was speaking answers to questions that hadn't been asked yet.

"I'm here." Past-tense. Present-tense. Future-tense. All simultaneously true.

"We're reading massive neural coherence loss. Temporal desync across all measurement frames. I'm ordering emergency medical intervention."

"Negative." Sarah's voice sounded strange. Echoed. Like two people speaking slightly out of sync. "I'm functional."

"You're fragmenting!"

Was she? Sarah examined her thoughts. They felt normal. Ordered. Sequential.

Except they weren't.

She was thinking about post-jump protocols while simultaneously remembering the jump initiation while planning her dinner while recalling her Academy graduation.

Linear time was gone.

She existed in all moments at once.

"Neural activity stabilizing," Kenji said. Surprised. "She's adapting."

"That's impossible."

"Tell that to her hippocampus. It's restructuring in real-time. Creating new pathways for non-linear temporal processing."

Sarah felt it happening. Her brain rewiring itself. Accepting temporal paradox as normal. Learning to think across multiple timestreams simultaneously.

Was this evolution or breakdown?

"Sarah, I need you to focus on my voice. Can you identify which moment you're in right now?"

She considered the question. Right now. As if "now" was a singular, identifiable point. As if time was linear and moments were discrete.

"I'm in all of them."

"That's the desync talking."

"No. That's me talking. The desync is real. But so is this." Sarah looked at her hands. They appeared solid. Single. But she could feel multiple versions—past hands, present hands, future hands—all occupying the same space.

"We're bringing you in. Medical team standing by."

The jump ship's autopilot took over. Sarah sat in the cockpit and experienced her return to the facility across multiple timelines simultaneously.

She was landing.
She had landed.
She would land.

All true.

The medical team rushed her to the neural imaging suite. Dr. Mbara ran scan after scan, each one showing impossible results.

"Her brain is stable. But it's operating in a quantum superposition of temporal states. She's not experiencing time linearly anymore."

"Can we fix it?" Admiral Kowalski asked.

Sarah answered before Aisha could. "Why would you want to?"

Silence in the medical bay.

"Lieutenant Chen," Kowalski said carefully, "are you aware of what's happening to you?"

"I'm aware of what happened, is happening, and will happen. All simultaneously. My consciousness is no longer bound to linear causality." Sarah sat up. The room didn't spin. Multiple versions of the room existed simultaneously, but her brain processed them all. "I can think across timestreams now."

"That's the neural damage talking."

"That's evolution talking." Sarah looked at Kenji. "You wanted to solve the navigation drift. I can help. I can see the temporal components now. Feel them. The bubble collapse creates microsecond causal loops. The ship arrives before it departs, but only by infinitesimal amounts."

Kenji pulled up his calculations. "If you're right—if you can actually perceive temporal causality—you could provide data we can't measure."

"Or she's having a psychotic break and confabulating meaningless observations." Aisha highlighted the neural scans. "Her hippocampus is restructuring. We don't know if these perceptions are real or hallucinations from a fragmenting consciousness."

Sarah closed her eyes. Saw past, present, future overlaid.

"Test me. Ask me something only temporal perception could answer."

Kenji thought. "During bubble collapse, does the ship experience uniform temporal variance or is there a gradient?"

Sarah didn't hesitate. "Gradient. The forward sections emerge point-zero-zero-three seconds before aft sections. Creates rotational momentum in spacetime that manifests as navigation drift."

Silence.

Kenji ran the calculations. Pulled up the drift patterns. Overlaid Sarah's numbers.

Perfect match.

"How did you know that?"

"I felt it. During collapse. My neurons at different positions in my skull experienced different emergence times. The gradient was measurable." Sarah opened her eyes. "I'm not broken, Kenji. I'm changed. And I can help solve this."

Admiral Kowalski stepped forward. "Lieutenant Chen, are you volunteering for continued jump operations?"

"I'm saying I'm the only person who can perceive the temporal mechanics accurately. You want to fix the navigation drift? You need me experiencing it."

"This is insane," Aisha said. "We don't know the long-term effects. She could fragment completely. Lose coherent consciousness. Become trapped between timelines."

"Or I could help humanity achieve reliable FTL travel." Sarah met her eyes. "I knew the risks. They changed. But so did I."

Kowalski studied her. Military calculation weighing human cost against strategic gain.

"Dr. Yamamoto, can you use Lieutenant Chen's temporal perceptions to solve the navigation problem?"

Kenji hesitated. Science versus ethics. Progress versus safety.

"Yes. If her perceptions are accurate, we can model the temporal gradients and compensate."

"Then jump six is approved. Lieutenant Chen provides real-time temporal data during transition. We solve this."

"Admiral—" Aisha started.

"That's an order, Doctor."

Sarah stood. The room existed in three timeframes. She existed in three timeframes.

But for the first time since jump one, she felt purpose.

She was broken. Changed. Transformed into something that existed outside normal causality.

But maybe that wasn't damage.

Maybe it was the price of understanding.

And maybe understanding was worth the cost.

Even if the cost was everything.
