Lieutenant Sarah Chen floated in the observation pod, watching Earth recede through the reinforced viewport. Six weeks since her last jump. Her body had mostly recovered from the temporal effects.

Mostly.

Her hands still showed fine tremors. Dr. Mbara said it was neurological damage from quantum desynchronization. Might be permanent.

A reminder that every jump had costs beyond just accelerated aging.

"How are you feeling?" Dr. Kenji Yamamoto's voice came through her earpiece.

"Like someone who aged six months in three weeks. But functional." Sarah pulled her focus from Earth to the testing facility orbiting Jupiter. "Is the remote operation system ready?"

"Hardware is installed. We're doing final calibration now." Yamamoto appeared on her video feed, looking exhausted. "Sarah, you don't have to do this test. We can use simulation pilots."

"Simulations won't show us biological effects. We need a real pilot linked through quantum entanglement." Sarah pulled on her neural interface helmet. "Besides, this is my idea. If it works, I solve the problem I helped create."

"If it fails, we might not be able to extract you from the entanglement safely."

"Understood. Let's do it anyway."

The helmet settled around her skull, neural contacts engaging with practiced ease. Sarah felt the familiar tingle of neural linkage, but this time the connection extended further. Beyond her own nervous system. Into quantum processors designed to maintain coherence across interstellar distances.

"Neural link established," Yamamoto reported. "Beginning quantum entanglement sequence."

Sarah felt something shift. Not physically. Somewhere deeper. Like her consciousness was spreading, extending beyond the boundary of her skull.

"Entanglement stable. Sarah, can you feel the remote systems?"

She could. The test ship, parked three light-minutes away, appeared in her awareness like an extension of her body. She could feel its engines, its navigation systems, its structural stress points.

All without temporal desynchronization.

"I have control," she said. "It feels like flying, but... different. More direct. Like the ship is part of me."

"That's the quantum link. Your consciousness is entangled with the ship's control systems. When you think of an action, the ship responds instantaneously despite the distance."

Sarah tested the connection. Fired attitude thrusters, adjusted navigation, ran systems diagnostics. All responded as if she were in the pilot's seat, not three light-minutes away.

"This is incredible. No lag, no delay. Just pure control."

"Now the real test. We're going to initiate a jump. You'll stay here, controlling the ship remotely. If the theory works, the ship will experience the temporal effects, but you won't."

"And if the theory doesn't work?"

"Then we abort and try to figure out what went wrong. Ready?"

Sarah took a deep breath. "Ready. Initiating jump sequence."

The ship's jump drive spooled up. Through the quantum link, Sarah felt the spacetime bubble beginning to form. The Alcubierre metric bending reality around the distant vessel.

Then jump.

From Sarah's perspective in the observation pod, nothing happened. She felt the ship transition through the bubble, emerge three light-years away. But her body stayed in normal spacetime. No nausea. No temporal displacement. No accelerated aging.

"Jump successful," she reported, her voice shaking with excitement. "I'm still here. No biological effects. The ship jumped, but I didn't."

Yamamoto's voice carried equal excitement. "Confirming. Your telemetry shows zero temporal desynchronization. No cellular aging. No neural stress. Sarah, it worked. Remote operation via quantum entanglement solves the biological cost problem."

Sarah laughed, feeling tears on her face. "We did it. We actually did it."

"You did it. Your suffering pointed us toward the solution." Yamamoto's image showed his own tears. "Sarah, you just made safe FTL travel possible. Every pilot from now on will benefit from your sacrifice."

The celebration was short-lived. The quantum entanglement began deteriorating.

"Decoherence increasing," Yamamoto reported. "The link is degrading. We need to return the ship before we lose connection entirely."

Sarah fought to maintain the link, but felt it slipping away. Like trying to hold water in her hands. The ship's controls became sluggish, unreliable.

"Initiating return jump now, while I still have partial control."

The ship jumped back. Emerged near Jupiter with Sarah's tenuous control barely maintaining stability.

"Link failed," she reported. "I've lost the quantum connection."

"Expected. Current entanglement technology can't maintain coherence through multiple jumps. But Sarah, you controlled that ship for eighteen minutes across interstellar distances. That's proof of concept."

Sarah removed the neural helmet, feeling disconnected. Empty. The ship had been part of her for those eighteen minutes. Now it was just a distant object again.

"How long until we can maintain stable entanglement for extended missions?"

"Years. Maybe a decade. We need better quantum error correction, more robust entanglement generation, faster decoherence compensation." Yamamoto pulled up research projections. "But the foundation is proven. Remote piloting works. We just need to refine it."

Admiral Kowalski was less enthusiastic when Sarah briefed him on the results.

"Eighteen minutes isn't enough for operational missions. Most FTL transits will take hours. Some might take days."

"Which is why we need continued research funding," Yamamoto argued. "We proved the concept. Now we scale it up."

"Fleet Command wanted operational systems in eighteen months. This timeline is years longer."

"Fleet Command wanted systems that didn't kill pilots. That takes time to develop properly." Yamamoto's voice was firm. "Admiral, you can have it fast, or you can have it safe. Not both."

Kowalski was quiet for a moment. "I'll present your findings to Fleet Command. But Yamamoto, Sarah, be prepared for pushback. There are people who want FTL capability now, regardless of biological costs."

"Then they can volunteer to pilot the current systems themselves," Sarah said. "See how they like aging a year every few jumps."

After the admiral left, Sarah found Dr. Mbara in medical.

"How's your recovery going?" Mbara asked.

"Physically, I'm stable. The tremors are persistent but manageable." Sarah held out her shaking hands. "Psychologically... that's harder. I had a taste of what safe FTL feels like. Going back to biological jumps would be torture."

"Then don't. You've done enough testing. Let someone else carry the burden now."

"There are three other test pilots. All showing aging effects. All accumulating damage." Sarah pulled up their medical records. "If I stop flying, they have to fly more to maintain the test schedule."

"That's their choice to make. Just like it's yours."

Sarah thought about that. Choice. The luxury of choosing whether to risk yourself.

Not all pilots had that luxury. Fleet would eventually mandate FTL operations. Someone would fly those missions, consequences be damned.

Better to solve the problem before that happened.

"I'll keep flying," Sarah decided. "But only test flights for remote operation development. No more biological jumps unless absolutely necessary."

"That's reasonable. And Sarah? Thank you. For everything you've contributed. The future of space travel is safer because of your sacrifice."

"I just don't want anyone else to go through what I did."

"Then keep working with Yamamoto. Help him solve the remaining problems. You understand the biological interface better than anyone."

Over the next six months, Sarah became Yamamoto's primary test pilot for quantum entanglement systems. Each test pushed the boundaries a little further. Twenty minutes of stable link. Thirty. Forty-five.

Progress was slow but steady.

The tremors in her hands remained. A permanent reminder of the costs already paid.

But Sarah accepted them. Battle scars from a war against physics itself.

She'd won more battles than she'd lost. Suffered damage, but survived.

And helped ensure that future pilots wouldn't suffer the same.

That was worth the cost.

Worth the tremors. Worth the lost years. Worth all of it.

Because science wasn't just about discovery. It was about protecting people from what you discovered.

Making the future safer than the past.

Sarah Chen had done that.

And she'd keep doing it, for as long as her damaged body allowed.

Because some causes were worth fighting for.

Even when the fight left permanent scars.

Especially then.
