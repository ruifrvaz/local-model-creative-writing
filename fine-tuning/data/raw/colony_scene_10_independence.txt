Rivera's message came through at 0200. Priority encryption. Eyes-only for senior staff.

Alexis read it twice before believing it.

Earth Corp was canceling the colony. Complete withdrawal. Transport ships arriving in six months to evacuate personnel back to orbit.

The Mars colony experiment: terminated.

She called Hassan and Yuki immediately. They gathered in the empty command center, reading the message in stunned silence.

"They're abandoning us?" Yuki said finally. "After everything we built?"

"Not abandoning. Evacuating." Rivera appeared exhausted. "Earth Corp's board decided Mars colonization isn't economically viable. They're cutting losses and redeploying assets."

"We're profitable," Hassan protested. "The aquifer, the archaeological find, the improved crop yields—"

"We're not profitable enough. Earth Corp wanted exponential returns. We're delivering linear growth." Rivera pulled up financial projections. "According to their analysis, Mars won't show positive ROI for another forty years. They're not willing to wait."

Alexis felt rage building. "So they're pulling out. Leaving the infrastructure to rot. Wasting two years of survival effort."

"They're offering relocation bonuses. New assignments on orbital stations or lunar facilities. Full salary continuation." Rivera met her eyes. "They're not punishing us. They're reallocating."

"Feels like punishment."

"Feels like corporate resource management." Rivera leaned back. "But here's the interesting part. The evacuation isn't mandatory. Anyone who wants to stay can petition for independent status. Earth Corp would sell the colony infrastructure at salvage rates."

"Sell to who? We don't have capital."

"We have collective resources. Three hundred colonists pooling assets. Plus we could seek external investment. Private individuals who'd back an independent Mars operation."

Yuki was already doing math. "Salvage rates for this infrastructure... maybe two million credits total. Divided among three hundred colonists, that's under seven thousand each."

"Most colonists don't have seven thousand credits," Hassan said.

"But some do. And some have access to credit. And some could find investors." Rivera pulled up a preliminary financing plan. "I've been running numbers since I got the cancellation notice. It's tight but possible."

"You want to buy the colony?" Alexis asked.

"I want to offer colonists the choice. Stay and own this operation. Or return to Earth Corp employment." Rivera pulled up the proposed structure. "We'd form an independent cooperative. Democratic governance. Profit-sharing instead of salaries. Complete autonomy from Earth Corp."

"Also complete loss of Earth Corp support. No supply shipments. No technical assistance. No backup if things go wrong."

"Correct. We'd be self-sufficient or we'd die trying." Rivera smiled grimly. "But we've been functionally self-sufficient for months. Earth Corp's supplies have been supplementary, not essential."

Alexis reviewed the proposal. It was audacious. Insane. Possibly brilliant.

"How many colonists would commit?" she asked.

"Unknown. But I'm betting at least half. These are people who chose Mars over Earth. Who survived conditions that would've broken weaker individuals. They didn't come here for corporate careers."

"They came to build something."

"Exactly. And Earth Corp is giving us the chance to build it independently."

The vote was held three weeks later. After extensive community meetings. Financial reviews. Honest assessment of risks.

Two hundred and twelve colonists voted to stay. Eighty-eight chose evacuation.

The staying majority pooled resources. Some contributed personal savings. Others secured credit against future Mars-based assets. A few found private investors willing to back the venture.

Within two months, they'd raised the capital. Purchased the colony infrastructure from Earth Corp at salvage rates.

The Mars Colony became the Mars Cooperative. Independent operation. Self-governed. Owned by its inhabitants.

Earth Corp's transport arrived on schedule. Eighty-eight colonists departed. Most amicably. A few with bitter words about abandoning corporate security for independence fantasy.

Alexis watched the transport depart from the observation deck. Two hundred and twelve people remaining. No corporate backup. No guaranteed resupply.

Just Mars and their determination.

"Think we'll make it?" Hassan asked, joining her.

"Honestly? No idea. We're operating outside any established model. Independent planetary colony with no governmental or corporate support." Alexis smiled. "We're either pioneers or idiots."

"Both probably."

"Definitely both."

Rivera convened the first Cooperative Council the next day. Democratic representation. One vote per colonist. Major decisions required majority consensus.

"We're writing new rules," Rivera said. "For governance. For resource allocation. For conflict resolution. We have no template. We make this up as we go."

"That's terrifying," someone called out.

"Absolutely. But it's ours. Our terror. Our success. Our failures." Rivera pulled up the infrastructure inventory. "We own two hundred buildings. Four hundred hectares of developed land. Complete mining and processing equipment. And one pristine aquifer. That's our capital. How we deploy it determines our future."

The debate lasted six hours. Proposals for agricultural expansion. Mining operations. Research programs. Tourism infrastructure for wealthy Earth visitors.

Every idea had merit. Every idea had risks.

The final plan was conservative. Focus on self-sufficiency. Build food security. Establish reliable power. Only then consider expansion.

"We survived Earth Corp rule," Alexis said during the planning session. "Now we survive ourselves. That's harder."

The first independent year was brutal. Equipment failures without corporate backup. Supply shortages requiring creative rationing. Conflicts that corporate hierarchy had suppressed now surfacing in democratic governance.

But they adapted.

The aquifer sustained agricultural expansion. The alien artifact became research magnet, attracting private funding from institutions Earth Corp had excluded. The Martian-hybrid crops proved more productive than Earth-stock varieties.

Year two showed modest surplus. Not profit exactly—the Cooperative reinvested everything into infrastructure. But sustainability.

Year three brought new colonists. Not corporate employees. Independent contractors. Scientists on private grants. Even a few tourists willing to pay enormous sums for Mars experience.

The population grew to three hundred fifty. Then four hundred. Then five hundred.

The Mars Cooperative became the Mars Settlement. Independent polity. Not quite sovereign state but close enough.

Alexis stood at the observation deck five years after independence. The settlement sprawled across the valley—far larger than the original corporate colony.

Hassan joined her. "You know what Earth Corp's biggest mistake was?"

"Besides abandoning their investment?"

"They thought Mars had to be profitable to be valuable. They missed the point entirely." Hassan gestured at the settlement. "This isn't about quarterly returns. It's about building human presence beyond Earth. The value is existential, not financial."

"Think they realize that now?"

"Earth Corp filed for bankruptcy last year. Turns out abandoning their most successful colony wasn't great business strategy." Hassan smiled. "Meanwhile we're thriving. On our own terms."

Alexis thought about the journey. Corporate colony to independent settlement. Survival to sustainability. Dependence to autonomy.

They'd done it. Built something unprecedented.

"We're Martians now," she said. "Not Earth colonists. Not corporate employees. Martians."

"How does that feel?"

"Terrifying. Exhilarating. Right." Alexis looked at the red landscape. "Like home."

"Yeah. Like home."

The settlement grew.

The cooperative thrived.

Mars welcomed its new natives.

And Earth Corp became historical footnote in the story of humanity's expansion.

The independent spirit that built the settlement?

That became legend.

One cooperative decision at a time.
