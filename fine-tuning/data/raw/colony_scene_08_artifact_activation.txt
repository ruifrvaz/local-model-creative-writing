Alexis woke to find Hassan missing.

His bunk was empty. His pressure suit was gone. The equipment airlock showed a solo exit at 0400.

She pulled up his personnel tracker. Signal active. Location: the alien structure they'd discovered three months ago. The one Rivera had ordered sealed pending Earth Corp guidance.

"Damn it, Hassan," Alexis muttered.

She suited up and followed. The sun was rising over Valles Marineris, painting the canyon walls in shades of rust and gold. Beautiful and deadly.

Hassan was at the structure entrance. He'd cut through the security seal and descended into the chamber.

Alexis cycled through the airlock he'd left open. Her helmet light cut through the darkness, revealing the geometric walls covered in alien symbols.

Hassan stood before the crystalline artifact they'd found—the object on the pedestal that seemed to shift and reorganize as you watched it.

"You couldn't wait for proper authorization?" Alexis called.

Hassan didn't turn. "Been three months. Earth Corp hasn't responded. They're either ignoring us or classifying this so hard no one's allowed to acknowledge it."

"So you decided to break protocol?"

"I decided to do my job. Study the find. Document the discovery." Hassan gestured at the artifact. "This is the most important archaeological find in human history. I'm not letting it gather dust because corporate bureaucrats can't make decisions."

Alexis approached carefully. The artifact pulsed with faint luminescence. The geometric structure was mesmerizing—fractal patterns that seemed to extend into dimensions her eyes couldn't quite process.

"What have you learned?" she asked.

"It's active. Low-level energy emissions across multiple spectra. The internal structure is constantly rearranging. Like it's processing information." Hassan pulled up his scanner readings. "I think it's a data storage device. Or a computer. Or something we don't have words for."

"Can you access it?"

"That's the question." Hassan circled the pedestal. "The symbols on the walls aren't decoration. They're instructions. A guide to interacting with the artifact."

"You translated them?"

"Partially. The mathematics are universal. But the context is alien. It's like reading a programming manual in a language where half the concepts don't exist in human thought."

Alexis studied the wall symbols. Mathematical progressions, geometric patterns, stellar coordinates. Information dense and incomprehensible.

"Hassan, even if you could access this thing, should you? We don't know what it does. What safeguards it might have. What it might do if activated."

"All valid concerns. But they don't change the fundamental question." Hassan met her eyes. "Do we study this properly or let fear keep us ignorant?"

Alexis wanted to order him to stop. To seal the chamber and wait for proper protocols.

But Hassan was right. Earth Corp's silence was deafening. If they waited for authorization, they might wait forever.

"What do you need?" she asked.

Hassan smiled. "Equipment. The proper scanning gear is back at base. And maybe someone to verify my translation work. Make sure I'm not misinterpreting the symbols."

They returned to base camp. Yuki listened to Hassan's findings with growing excitement.

"You think it's information storage? Like a library?"

"Or a message. Or an encyclopedia. Or all of the above." Hassan pulled up the symbol translations. "The wall inscriptions reference the artifact as... I can't translate it exactly. But the closest approximation is 'inherited knowledge.'"

"Knowledge inherited from who?"

"The civilization that left this. Two hundred thousand years ago." Hassan enlarged a stellar map. "They wanted whoever found this to know they existed. What they learned. What they achieved."

"And what did they achieve?" Alexis asked.

"That's what we need to access the artifact to learn."

They worked through the day, translating symbols and building hypotheses. The wall inscriptions described a contact protocol—specific sequences of touch and electromagnetic interaction that would "wake" the artifact.

Rivera was briefed that evening. His response was predictable.

"Absolutely not. We're not activating an alien device without proper authorization and safety protocols."

"The authorization isn't coming," Hassan countered. "And the safety protocols don't exist because no one's ever done this before."

"Exactly. Which means we wait for experts."

"We are the experts. We're the ones who found it. Who've studied it. Who have the best understanding of what it is." Hassan pulled up his research. "Commander, this is why we're here. Why humanity came to Mars. To discover things. Activating this artifact is our purpose."

Rivera looked at Alexis. "Your opinion?"

"Hassan's right about Earth Corp's silence being a non-response. But he's also proposing something incredibly risky." Alexis studied the activation protocol. "Middle ground: We run preliminary activation. Minimal contact. See if the artifact responds. Pull back immediately if anything seems dangerous."

"Define dangerous."

"Energy spike. Structural instability. Unexpected reactions. Anything that suggests we're out of our depth."

Rivera considered. The weight of command visible in his posture. Authorize unknown alien contact or suppress discovery indefinitely.

"Preliminary activation only," he said finally. "Full documentation. If anything looks wrong, you shut it down immediately."

They returned to the alien structure the next day. Hassan, Alexis, Yuki, and Rivera. The minimal crew for a maximum discovery.

Hassan approached the artifact with a conducting stylus. According to the wall symbols, contact in specific geometric patterns would initiate the wake sequence.

He touched the first point. The artifact pulsed. Brighter.

Second point. Third. Fourth.

The geometric pattern completing.

The artifact's internal structure shifted. Faster. More deliberately. The luminescence increased, casting geometric shadows across the chamber walls.

Then it projected.

Holographic images appeared in the air above the pedestal. Not human imagery. Not anything evolved from Earth biology. Geometric patterns that conveyed meaning without representation.

"It's communicating," Yuki whispered.

The patterns cycled. Stellar maps. Mathematical equations. Chemical diagrams. Physics concepts that Hassan recognized and others that were completely alien.

"It's showing us their knowledge," Hassan said. "Everything they learned. Their science, their mathematics, their understanding of the universe."

"Can we record this?" Rivera asked.

"Already doing it." Alexis had every scanner running. "But we're getting terrabytes of data. This could take days to process."

The projection continued for two hours. Then stabilized on a final image.

A star map. Dozens of systems highlighted. And Earth's sun among them.

"They knew about us," Hassan realized. "Two hundred thousand years ago, they knew Earth existed. They were mapping potential civilizations."

"Did they visit?" Yuki asked.

"Maybe. Or maybe they just observed from a distance. Cataloged promising worlds." Hassan studied the map. "We're not alone. We never were."

The artifact's projection faded. The chamber returned to darkness. The crystalline structure pulsed once more, then went quiescent.

Hassan checked his instruments. "It's dormant again. The activation was temporary. A single transmission of their data."

"Can we activate it again?" Rivera asked.

"Possibly. But I'd want to analyze what we just recorded first. Understand what they were trying to tell us."

They sealed the chamber and returned to base. The recorded data was comprehensive—terabytes of alien knowledge, waiting to be decoded.

Alexis helped Hassan set up analysis protocols. This would take months. Years. Maybe decades to fully understand.

But they'd made contact. Across two hundred thousand years and incomprehensible differences, they'd received a message from beings who'd walked Mars when humanity was barely beginning.

"What do you think they were like?" Yuki asked that evening, reviewing the initial data.

"Curious," Hassan said. "Explorers. Teachers. They built that repository because they wanted others to learn. That says something profound about their values."

"And they disappeared. Whatever they built, it wasn't enough to save them."

"Maybe. Or maybe they moved on. Evolved beyond physical form. Transcended into something we can't recognize." Hassan pulled up the stellar maps. "The knowledge they left is a gift. Our job is to be worthy of receiving it."

The data analysis consumed the colony. Everyone contributed—scientists, engineers, even administrators helping with pattern recognition and translation.

Slowly, the alien knowledge revealed itself. Physics beyond human understanding. Chemistry involving elements that didn't exist on Earth. Mathematics that described realities human senses couldn't perceive.

And questions. So many questions.

Why had they left this knowledge? What had they hoped future civilizations would do with it? What had happened to them?

Hassan didn't have answers. Just the artifacts and the data and the humbling recognition that humanity was one chapter in a much longer story.

"We're inheritors," he told Alexis one night. "They left this for us. For anyone curious enough to find it and brave enough to learn from it."

"Heavy responsibility."

"Best kind." Hassan smiled. "We came to Mars to discover. We're succeeding beyond anyone's expectations."

The red planet held secrets. Ancient and profound.

And humanity was finally beginning to listen.
