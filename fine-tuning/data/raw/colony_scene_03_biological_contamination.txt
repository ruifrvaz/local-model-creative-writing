The hydroponics bay smelled like failure. Yuki Tanaka stood among the withering tomato plants, watching the leaves curl and brown despite perfect atmospheric conditions.

"CO2 levels are optimal," she said into her recorder. "Nutrients balanced. Light spectrum matches Earth standard. But the plants are dying anyway."

Something was wrong with Mars itself. The regolith-based growing medium worked in the lab. The chemical analysis showed sufficient minerals. But the moment they scaled up to production farming, everything failed.

The colony had four months of frozen rations. Maybe five if they stretched it. After that, they'd be dependent on hydroponics.

Which meant they'd starve.

Yuki pulled a tissue sample from a dying tomato plant. The cells showed stress markers that shouldn't exist—oxidative damage despite controlled oxygen levels, membrane degradation in perfect pH conditions.

Like the plants were fighting a battle she couldn't see.

"Dr. Tanaka." Alexis Kwan stood at the bay entrance, her expression grim. "We need to talk about your requisition for new growth substrate."

"The current batch is contaminated somehow. I need fresh material."

"There is no fresh material. Earth won't ship more for six months. And corporate says we should make what we have work." Alexis crossed to the dying plants. "What's killing them?"

"I don't know. The regolith chemistry is wrong somehow. Or there's something in it we didn't test for." Yuki pulled up her analysis results. "I've run every standard agricultural test. Everything passes. But the plants know something we don't."

Alexis examined the data. "What about radiation? Cosmic rays, solar particles?"

"Shielded. We're getting less exposure than Earth standard."

"Chemical toxins?"

"Nothing above threshold. I even tested for perchlorates—they're elevated, but we filtered them out." Yuki gestured at the dying crop. "This is something else. Something biological, maybe."

"Mars doesn't have biology."

"Mars isn't supposed to have a lot of things." Yuki thought of Hassan's discovery in the subsurface. The geometric patterns. The alien structure that corporate had immediately classified. "But maybe we're wrong about that."

Alexis went very still. "You think this is related to Hassan's find."

"I think we're living on a planet we don't understand. And I think it might be defending itself."

The words hung in the recycled air. Alexis looked at the dying plants with new eyes.

"That's crazy," she said. But her voice lacked conviction.

"Is it? Hassan found evidence of an ancient civilization. Structure buried beneath the surface. And now our plants are dying from causes we can't identify." Yuki pulled up a soil microscopy scan. "Look at this."

The image showed crystalline structures. Microscopic. Embedded in the regolith at a cellular level. They looked almost like viruses, but too regular. Too geometric.

"What are those?"

"I don't know. They weren't in the original samples. But they're everywhere now. And they're growing." Yuki zoomed in. The crystals had fractured the plant cell walls, invaded the cytoplasm, replaced organic structures with something inorganic and alien. "It's like the Martian soil is... converting them."

Alexis swore quietly. "Have you told Rivera?"

"Not yet. I wanted to be sure first."

"Be sure of what? That Mars is alive? That we're trying to farm on something that doesn't want us here?" Alexis started backing toward the door. "We need to quarantine this bay. Now."

"Wait." Yuki grabbed her arm. "If we tell Rivera, corporate will shut down all agricultural research. They'll declare the colony non-viable and evacuate. Everything we've built—"

"Will be worth nothing if whatever's in that soil gets into our bodies." Alexis pulled free. "Or have you tested for that?"

Yuki hadn't. The realization hit like a fist. She'd been so focused on saving the crops that she hadn't considered human exposure. The dust they breathed despite the filters. The water they drank, processed through Martian regolith. The very air they recycled, pulled from an atmosphere they barely understood.

"We need blood samples," she said. "From everyone."

"And if we find these crystals in our bloodstream?"

"Then we figure out what they are and how to stop them." Yuki looked at the dying plants. They were the canary in the coal mine. The early warning system.

And they were screaming.

Alexis pulled out her comm. "I'll get the medical kit. You start with yourself—if you've been working with contaminated material, you're the highest risk."

Yuki nodded and moved to the medical station. Her hands shook as she prepared the blood draw. Not from fear of needles. From the terrible possibility that Mars had already invaded her cells, was already converting her biology into something else.

The needle slid in. Dark blood filled the vial.

Under the microscope, it looked normal at first. Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets suspended in plasma. All standard. Yuki let herself breathe.

Then she increased magnification.

There. At the edge of a red blood cell. A crystalline structure. Maybe a micron across. Growing.

"Alexis." Her voice cracked. "We have a problem."

Kwan appeared at her shoulder. Looked at the screen. Went pale.

"How long?" she asked.

"I don't know. Days. Weeks. The growth rate is slow, but it's definitely happening." Yuki prepared another slide, this time from a dying tomato plant. Under the microscope, the crystals were identical. "We're being converted. Just like the plants."

"Converted into what?"

That was the question that terrified Yuki most. The crystals weren't killing her cells—they were changing them. Incorporating alien structures into human biology with a precision that suggested intelligence. Purpose.

"I don't know," she said. "But I don't think it's finished yet."

Alexis stood very still. Yuki watched her process the information, saw the engineer's mind working through the implications. Quarantine. Medical emergency. Potential colony-wide contamination.

"We tell Rivera," Alexis said finally. "And we tell her everything. Hassan's discovery, the crystals, the blood samples. All of it."

"She'll evacuate the colony."

"Maybe. Or maybe she'll fight." Alexis met her eyes. "But we can't fight what we're hiding from. And we can't survive if we lie about the stakes."

Yuki looked at the microscope. At the alien crystal growing in her blood. At the decision that might doom them all or save them.

"Okay," she said. "We tell her. But we also tell her this: Mars isn't dead. It's just different. And maybe, if we understand it instead of fighting it, we can learn to live here without destroying each other."

Alexis nodded slowly. "Then let's hope she's listening. Because we're running out of time."

The hydroponics bay lights flickered. Just for a second. Yuki told herself it was a power fluctuation. Normal. Expected.

But deep down, she wondered if Mars was paying attention after all.

And if it liked what it saw.
