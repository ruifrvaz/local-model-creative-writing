Ambassador Chen Wu read the casualty report three times before he believed it.

Seventeen dead. Forty-two injured. A bomb in the neutral zone market, timed to coincide with the peace talks.

Someone wanted these negotiations to fail. Badly.

He looked up from his terminal to find Lena Volkov standing in his office doorway. The security officer's uniform was scorched, her face smudged with soot.

"You were there," Chen said.

"Fifty meters from the blast. I got lucky." Volkov closed the door and activated the privacy screen. "This wasn't random terrorism. The device was sophisticated. Military-grade explosives, precise timing, placed to maximize casualties without breaching the hull."

"So someone who knows station architecture. Who understands explosive yield calculations in low gravity." Chen pulled up the security footage. The blast had been almost surgical—devastating to people, harmless to infrastructure. "Someone who wanted to send a message without killing the negotiations entirely."

"By killing seventeen people?"

"By proving they could have killed everyone." Chen enhanced the footage. The bomber had placed the device near the water recyclers—critical systems for station survival. But the explosive was shaped to direct force away from the equipment. "This was a demonstration. Next time, they're saying, we won't be so careful."

Volkov leaned over his shoulder. "The Coalition delegates are demanding increased security. The Frontier delegates want us to expel anyone with Coalition ties. Station Director Nkrumah is trying to keep everyone from walking out."

"Of course he is. If these talks fail, the shooting war starts. And this station sits directly in the crossfire." Chen closed the footage. "Who had access to the market during the placement window?"

"Everyone. It's a public space. We have six thousand residents, another two thousand visitors. Any one of them could have placed the device." Volkov pulled up the suspect list. "But I've narrowed it to forty-seven people with demolitions training and motive to disrupt negotiations."

"Show me."

The list was depressingly diverse. Coalition sympathizers. Frontier radicals. Corporate security contractors. Independent operatives who didn't care about ideology, only credits.

"Anyone stand out?" Chen asked.

"Three. All with records of prior sabotage, all with documented presence in the market ninety minutes before the blast." Volkov highlighted the names. "But here's the problem—they all have alibis for the actual placement time. Witnesses, security footage, biometric logs. They were somewhere else when the bomb was planted."

"So they're working with someone. Or the bomber is someone not on our watch list." Chen stood and moved to the window. Orbital Station Kepler hung against the black, a wheel of metal and hope spinning in the void. "How many people on this station want peace?"

"Most of them. But most people aren't willing to kill for it."

"And the ones who are willing to kill to prevent it?" Chen turned back. "Those are the ones we need to find. Before they succeed."

His comm chimed. Director Nkrumah requesting immediate presence in the council chamber. Both delegates were threatening to leave.

Chen arrived to find chaos. The Coalition ambassador was shouting in Mandarin. The Frontier representative was responding in Russian. Neither was listening to the other. Neither cared about diplomatic protocol anymore.

Nkrumah sat at the head of the table, his expression carefully neutral despite the carnage of his negotiation efforts.

"Gentlemen," Chen said in English, the designated neutral language. "Seventeen people are dead. Forty-two are in medical. Screaming at each other won't bring them back."

"The Coalition killed them," Ambassador Volkov—no relation to Lena—spat. "This is typical Coalition aggression. Terrorism disguised as—"

"The Frontier planted that bomb," Coalition Ambassador Zhang shot back. "You want these talks to fail. You profit from war."

"Both of you are wrong," Chen said flatly. "Or you're both right. Because whoever planted that bomb wants exactly this—mutual accusations, broken trust, failed diplomacy. They're succeeding brilliantly while you help them."

The room went quiet. Nkrumah nodded almost imperceptibly.

"Ambassador Chen makes a point," the Director said. "This station is neutral ground. We host these talks because both sides agree peace is preferable to conflict. Someone disagrees. Someone with access to military-grade explosives and detailed station knowledge. Finding them should be our shared priority."

"Unless one of us already knows who they are," Frontier Ambassador Volkov said.

Chen felt the temperature in the room drop. This was the moment where cooperation died and paranoia took over.

"Then let's find out," he said. "Full transparency. All delegations open their security files to joint investigation. Every member of both diplomatic teams undergoes background verification. We eliminate suspects through cooperation, not accusation."

"You're asking us to expose classified information to potential enemies," Zhang said.

"I'm asking you to decide whether you want peace or pride. Because you can't have both." Chen pulled up the casualty list. "Seventeen people. Mechanics, shopkeepers, teachers. None of them were diplomats. None of them had a stake in your political struggles. They died because someone wanted to make a point about how easy it is to kill civilians."

Zhang looked at the list. His expression softened. Slightly.

"Twenty-four hours," he said. "We open our files for twenty-four hours. Joint investigation team. But if we find evidence of Frontier involvement—"

"Then we act on it together," Nkrumah said. "This investigation is neutral or it's nothing."

Volkov was quiet for a long moment. "Agreed. Twenty-four hours. But I want Lena Volkov on the investigation team. She has my government's trust."

"And I want Captain Martinez," Zhang said. "Coalition security observer."

Chen nodded. "Then we have a team. Director Nkrumah oversees. Lena Volkov and Captain Martinez investigate. Both delegations provide full cooperation. We have twenty-four hours to find a bomber before they strike again."

The meeting adjourned. Chen remained in the council chamber, staring at the casualty list.

Seventeen people. The number felt heavier every time he looked at it.

His comm buzzed. Lena Volkov, private channel.

"Ambassador, we have a problem. I just reviewed the bomb components. The explosives are Coalition military issue. But the detonator is Frontier technology. Someone combined both sides' equipment to make this look like joint responsibility."

Chen closed his eyes. Worse and worse.

"Can you trace the components?"

"Working on it. But Chen—whoever did this has access to both sides' military hardware. That's a very short list of people."

"Including members of our own delegation."

"Including everyone," Volkov said quietly. "Trust no one. Not even me."

The channel closed. Chen looked out at the station, at the thousands of people trying to build lives in neutral space, away from Earth's conflicts.

Someone wanted to drag those conflicts here. Wanted to turn Kepler into a battlefield.

And Chen had twenty-four hours to stop them.

He pulled up the diplomatic security files and started reading.

Somewhere in the data, a bomber was hiding. Someone who believed violence was the answer to questions that should never have been asked.

Chen just had to find them before they answered again.
