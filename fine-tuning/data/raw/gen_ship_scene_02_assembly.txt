Captain Ana Reyes stood before the assembled crew and knew half of them wanted her removed.

The auditorium was packed. Seven thousand people—three generations born on the Endeavor, two more conceived and raised while their ancestors traveled between stars. All of them waiting for her to explain why they should continue a mission that would kill them before completion.

"We vote in forty-eight hours," she began. "Abandon mission and settle on Kepler-442b, or continue to our original target at Proxima Centauri. I won't tell you how to vote. But I will tell you what I know."

She pulled up images of Kepler-442b. The planet hung in holographic space, ruddy and cold.

"Surface gravity one-point-four Earth standard. Atmosphere thin but breathable. Average temperature minus twenty Celsius. Liquid water exists near the equator. Survival is possible." Reyes paused. "Thriving is questionable. The geological surveys suggest limited arable land. Resources sufficient for a small population. Maybe ten thousand people. Maybe less."

She pulled up population projections. "We currently have ten thousand three hundred crew members. With current birth rates, we'll reach twelve thousand in twenty years. Kepler-442b cannot support that population sustainably. We'd have to implement strict birth controls. Resource rationing. Potential lottery systems for reproductive rights."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Reyes continued.

"Proxima Centauri b, by contrast, has a seventy percent probability of being Earth-like. Moderate gravity. Dense atmosphere. Surface water. If the projections are correct, it could support millions. No rationing. No birth restrictions. True colonization instead of marginal survival."

"Two hundred years away," someone shouted from the back. "None of us will see it."

"True. But your great-grandchildren might. If we continue. If we complete what our ancestors started." Reyes pulled up the departure logs from Earth. "Our grandparents left knowing they'd die in transit. They made that sacrifice willingly. Because they believed in a future beyond themselves."

"They didn't know we'd be facing genetic collapse," another voice called. Dr. Okoye. The medical director stood. "Captain, tell them the truth. About the inbreeding. The mutations. The degradation."

Reyes nodded. "Dr. Okoye is correct. Our genetic diversity is insufficient for multi-generational sustainability. Current projections suggest genetic viability collapses in fifty to seventy-five years. Before we reach Proxima Centauri."

The auditorium erupted. Shouts. Arguments. Fear spreading like fire through tinder.

Reyes raised her hand. Waited for quiet.

"There is a solution," she said. "But it requires a decision that goes beyond this referendum."

Malik Torres stood. The young engineer's expression was grim. "The ship can separate. Two independent vessels. One continues to Proxima. One diverts to Kepler. We split the population. Split the risk. Both missions proceed."

The auditorium went silent. Reyes watched the idea sink in. Separate the ship. Divide the crew. Create two humanities instead of one.

"That halves our genetic diversity," Okoye said. "Makes the collapse faster."

"Or it doubles our chances of survival," Malik countered. "One destination fails, the other might succeed. We're not putting all our genes in one basket."

"We're abandoning unity," Eva Sato said. The historian stood, her expression pained. "Everything our ancestors built was based on collective purpose. We separate, we lose that. We become two factions with diverging interests."

"We're already two factions," someone else called. "Might as well make it official."

Reyes watched her crew fracture in real-time. The unity that had sustained them for two hundred years was crumbling. And she was powerless to stop it.

"The separation is feasible," she said quietly. "Engineering has confirmed it. We can divide the Endeavor into two independent vessels. Both capable of sustained life support. Both capable of reaching their respective destinations."

"How do we decide who goes where?" The question came from multiple voices simultaneously.

"By choice. We take volunteers. Anyone who wants to continue to Proxima can. Anyone who wants to settle Kepler can. The split is voluntary." Reyes pulled up the logistics. "We'll need balanced populations. Engineers, doctors, farmers, teachers. Both ships need viable demographics. But within those constraints, you choose."

"And families?" A young mother stood, infant in her arms. "If my husband wants to continue and I want to settle, what happens?"

Reyes felt the weight of that question. Families torn apart. Marriages dissolved across millions of kilometers. Children forced to choose between parents.

"That's between you and your family," she said. "I can't make those choices for you. No one can."

The auditorium dissolved into chaos. People arguing. Crying. Trying to process the magnitude of the decision.

Reyes let them. Sometimes chaos was necessary before clarity emerged.

After thirty minutes, she raised her hand again. "We have forty-eight hours. Use that time wisely. Talk to your families. Consider your priorities. Research both options. Then vote. Not just on whether to continue or abandon. But on whether to stay together or separate. The ballot will include both questions."

She closed the projection. "Whatever happens, we're all human. We're all descendants of the people who left Earth seeking a better future. Don't lose sight of that. Don't let this decision destroy the bonds that have sustained us for two hundred years."

Reyes left the stage. Behind her, seven thousand voices rose in argument and desperation and hope.

In her quarters, she pulled up the private message from Earth. It had arrived three months ago, traveling at light speed, carrying news from a world she'd never seen.

Earth was dead. The climate collapse had accelerated. The remaining population had fled underground or into orbital habitats. The surface was toxic. Uninhabitable.

The Endeavor and its crew were humanity's best hope. Maybe its only hope.

Reyes hadn't told the crew. Hadn't revealed that going back wasn't an option because there was nothing to go back to.

But now, with the ship fragmenting, with the vote looming, maybe they needed to know.

Or maybe they needed hope more than truth.

She thought about her grandparents. The generation that had boarded the Endeavor knowing Earth was dying. They'd chosen optimism over despair. Future over present.

Reyes pulled up the ballot draft. Two questions. Continue or settle. Unity or separation.

She added a third option: Transparency. Tell the crew about Earth. Let them make informed decisions.

Or protect them from knowledge that might break what remained of their morale.

The cursor blinked. Waiting for her choice.

Captain Ana Reyes, third-generation ship commander, responsible for ten thousand lives and two hundred years of human hope, stared at the screen and wished her grandparents had left better instructions.

Because command was supposed to be about making hard decisions.

She just hadn't realized how hard they could be until the weight of humanity's future rested on which button she pressed.

The cursor blinked. The clock counted down. Forty-seven hours, fifty-three minutes.

Reyes made her choice.

And hoped it was the right one.
