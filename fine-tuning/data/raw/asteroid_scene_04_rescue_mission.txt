The pilot distress beacon came through at 0237 hours. Automated, emergency frequency, coordinates that put the source three million kilometers from the Lucky Strike's current position.

Kayla Okonkwo pulled up the signal details. "Small independent vessel. Transponder identifies it as the Dust Runner. Life support failing, requesting immediate assistance."

Captain Jax Torres checked their fuel reserves. Diverting to rescue would cost them a day and burn propellant they couldn't easily replace.

"How many crew?"

"Beacon says four. No other details."

The Belt had unwritten rules. Independents helped independents. Consortiums had rescue resources, emergency response teams, proper support infrastructure. Small miners had each other or they had nothing.

"Kayla, set course for the beacon. Best speed."

"That's going to cost us. Current mining contract has deadline penalties."

"Penalties are better than letting four people die. Move."

The Lucky Strike burned hard for three hours, covering the distance at acceleration that strained their aging engines. The Dust Runner came into view—a small mining ship, older than the Lucky Strike, trailing debris from what looked like a catastrophic decompression.

"Life signs?" Jax asked.

"Detecting three. Fourth must have been caught in the decompression."

"Get us in docking position."

They matched velocity and extended the docking collar. Kayla worked the controls with precision developed from years of difficult maneuvers. The collar sealed with a hiss of equalizing pressure.

Three survivors stumbled through. A pilot, an engineer, and someone who looked too young to be out here.

"Hull breach," the pilot gasped. "Micrometeorite impact. Lost Evans when the compartment blew."

Dr. Sofia Ruiz was already running medical scans. "Minor decompression injuries. You'll live. What's the damage to your ship?"

"Main hull breached, power failing, life support offline. She's dead in space."

Chen "Wrench" Liu pulled up the Dust Runner's status remotely. "Could salvage some equipment, but the ship itself is a loss. Hull integrity is compromised beyond field repair."

The pilot—a woman in her fifties with the haunted look of someone who'd just lost everything—sat heavily. "That ship was our life. Three years of mining to buy it. Now we've got nothing."

Jax knew that look. Every independent miner lived one disaster away from ruin. A bad contract, equipment failure, lucky meteorite strike—any of them could destroy years of work in minutes.

"You can ride with us to the nearest station. File insurance claims, figure out next steps."

"Insurance doesn't cover acts of nature in the Belt. We're done. Finished."

The young crew member—probably early twenties—was crying quietly. Wrench pulled him aside, offered water, spoke in low tones about how everyone in the Belt had lost something, how survival meant rebuilding.

Sofia checked the Dust Runner's cargo manifest. "They were carrying nickel-iron ore. Maybe ten thousand credits worth. We could transfer it to our hold, sell it, give them the proceeds."

"That barely covers transport to the station. Doesn't help them start over."

The rescued crew huddled together in the common area, processing shock and loss. Jax pulled his own crew aside.

"We've got the exotic matter," he said quietly. "Could give them a small piece. Enough to rebuild their operation."

"That's insane," Kayla said. "We barely have enough exotic matter for our own plans. And we don't even know these people."

"They're independent miners. Same as us. Code says we help."

"Code says we rescue. Doesn't say we bankrupt ourselves for strangers."

Sofia was torn. "One kilogram of exotic matter would set them up for years. But we only have eighty kilograms total. Every piece we give away reduces what we can do for ourselves."

Wrench spoke up. "What if we don't give them exotic matter directly? What if we give them information? Tell them where to find more?"

"2847-Delta is mined out. We took everything recoverable."

"But we learned how to detect exotic matter signatures. Techniques for identifying likely asteroids. If we share that knowledge..."

"They could find their own exotic matter. Start fresh with actual valuable claims."

It was still risky. Any information they shared could leak to consortiums. But it was less risky than giving away their limited supply.

Jax returned to the common area. The pilot looked up with hollow eyes.

"We'll get you to the station," he said. "And we'll give you something more valuable than money. We'll teach you how to find exotic matter."

The pilot's expression shifted from despair to disbelief. "You found exotic matter? And you're willing to share detection techniques?"

"Independent miners help independent miners. You rebuild your operation with what we teach you. Maybe someday you help someone else."

Over the next three days transit to the station, Wrench taught the Dust Runner's engineer how to identify exotic matter signatures. Sofia shared her analysis techniques. Kayla showed them stealth mining approaches for avoiding consortium attention.

The young crew member turned out to be a quick study. Asked smart questions about signal processing, energy detection, asteroid composition analysis.

"You're good at this," Sofia told him. "Keep learning. The Belt needs smart miners."

At the station, the Dust Runner crew prepared to disembark. The pilot pulled Jax aside.

"What you've given us—that's a second chance. More than we had any right to expect."

"Pay it forward. Help the next independent who needs it."

"We will. And if you ever need anything, you call us. We owe you."

After they'd left, Kayla pulled up the fuel consumption reports. "That rescue cost us eighteen thousand credits in fuel and missed contract penalties. We're operating at a loss this month."

"Worth it. Those people are alive and have a path forward."

"Sentimental doesn't pay for fuel."

"No, but it means we're not becoming the thing we're fighting against. Consortiums see everything as profit calculation. We see people."

Sofia was monitoring station communications. "The Dust Runner crew is already spreading word. Saying the Lucky Strike pulled off a miracle rescue and gave them tools to rebuild."

"That's good for reputation. Other independents will remember."

"Or consortiums will wonder why we're being generous with information. Might make them suspicious about what we found."

"Risk we take. Rather have independents as allies than hoard everything for ourselves."

Wrench was running long-term projections. "If the Dust Runner crew successfully finds exotic matter using our techniques, and if they share those techniques with other independents, we might start seeing wider distribution of exotic matter detection capability."

"Which reduces our competitive advantage."

"But strengthens independent mining overall. Harder for consortiums to monopolize exotic materials if multiple crews can find them."

Jax considered that. They'd set out to change their own fortunes. Might have accidentally started changing the game for all independent miners.

If the techniques worked. If the Dust Runner crew succeeded. If the information spread without reaching consortium ears.

Big ifs.

But they'd survived on big ifs for three years.

One more gamble wouldn't hurt.

"Send them off with our blessing," Jax said. "And hope we just made allies instead of competition."

"Optimistic."

"Have to be. Pessimism doesn't keep you alive in the Belt. Optimism and stubbornness do."

He watched the Dust Runner crew depart the station on a transport to the inner system, where they'd secure financing for a new ship and try again.

They'd lost everything once. But they had knowledge now. Techniques. A chance.

Maybe that was enough.

Maybe the Lucky Strike's real value wasn't in hoarding exotic matter for themselves but in spreading the tools that let independents fight back against consortium control.

Maybe helping others was how you won, even when the math said it cost too much.

The Belt was hard.

But humanity could be harder.

If they chose to be.

If they helped each other instead of competing for scraps.

If they remembered that survival was a collective effort, not an individual race.

Jax pulled up the next mining contract and got back to work.

The exotic matter was hidden. The techniques were shared. The future was uncertain.

Same as always.

But maybe, just maybe, a little brighter than before.

One rescued crew at a time.

One shared technique at a time.

One small act of solidarity against the grinding machinery of corporate control.

It wasn't much.

But it was something.

And in the Belt, something was often enough.
