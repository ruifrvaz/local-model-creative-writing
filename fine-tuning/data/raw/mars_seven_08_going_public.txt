Commander Rivera stood at the viewport in her office, watching the sunrise paint the Martian sky in shades of pink and orange. Behind her, Alexis and Hassan waited in uncomfortable silence.

"Say it again," Rivera said without turning. "Slowly this time."

Hassan cleared his throat. "We found a structure. Artificial, metallic, approximately three point two billion years old. Two connected chambers with what appear to be information storage or ceremonial objects."

"And you went inside without proper authorization."

"Yes, ma'am." Alexis kept her voice steady. "We made a command decision based on tactical assessment of the situation."

Rivera finally turned. Her expression was unreadable. "You mean you got excited and did something reckless."

"That too," Alexis admitted.

"Show me."

They transferred the footage to Rivera's display. She watched in silence as the camera panned across the metallic tunnel, the glowing walls, the chambers with their alien script.

When the sphere appeared on screen, Rivera leaned forward.

"What is that?"

"Unknown," Hassan said. "We didn't touch it. Didn't want to risk triggering... something."

"Something." Rivera replayed the footage. "That's a very scientific term, Doctor."

"We're in uncharted territory here, Commander. Everything is 'something' until we figure out what it actually is."

Rivera closed the file and pulled up a secure communication interface. "I need to inform Earth. This is beyond our authority to contain."

"Wait." Alexis stepped forward. "Commander, if you report this now, corporate will take over. They'll classify it, lock it down, and we'll never see it again. The crew who actually made the discovery will become footnotes."

"And if I don't report it, I'm violating about fifty different regulations." Rivera met her eyes. "I appreciate what you're trying to protect, Alexis. But this is bigger than our egos or our curiosity."

"It's not about ego. It's about doing this right." Hassan pulled up a document. "We've been drafting a comprehensive scientific paper. Full documentation, analysis, theoretical framework. Give us one week to finish it. Then we release everything simultaneously—Earth, academic institutions, public domain."

"You want to go public before corporate can classify it."

"I want to make sure the truth gets out," Hassan said. "If we hand this to corporate first, they'll control the narrative. Delay publication, restrict access, turn it into a proprietary asset instead of a scientific discovery."

Rivera was quiet for a long moment. "You're asking me to risk my career. Possibly face criminal charges. For what? To satisfy your scientific principles?"

"For the truth," Hassan said. "For making sure this belongs to humanity, not to a corporation."

"Idealistic." Rivera pulled up the mission charter. "And completely at odds with our contractual obligations. We're funded by Earth Corporation. Everything we discover technically belongs to them."

"Including alien artifacts?" Alexis challenged. "I'm pretty sure that wasn't in the contract."

"It wasn't. Because nobody expected this." Rivera closed the file. "Here's what's going to happen. You have seventy-two hours to complete your documentation. I'll prepare a report for Earth that emphasizes the geological findings and downplays the artificial nature of the structures."

"You're going to lie?"

"I'm going to be selectively precise with my language. There's a difference." Rivera pulled up a calendar. "On hour seventy-three, we transmit everything simultaneously. Full data package to academic institutions, summary to corporate, and detailed findings to the International Space Agency. Let them fight over jurisdiction while the science becomes public record."

Hassan grinned. "That's brilliant."

"That's career suicide. But you're right—this is too important to let corporate bury it." Rivera fixed them both with a hard stare. "Seventy-two hours. You do not return to that structure. You do not tell anyone else what you found. You work in the secure lab only. Clear?"

"Clear."

"And if corporate asks why I waited to report, my official position is that I was conducting due diligence to verify the findings before making extraordinary claims. Understood?"

They nodded.

"Good. Now get out of my office and start writing. You've got three days to change human history. Don't waste them."

Alexis and Hassan left, moving quickly through the corridors toward the lab. Neither spoke until they were sealed inside.

"She's going to get herself fired," Alexis said.

"Probably. But she's doing it anyway." Hassan pulled up the research files. "We need to make this count. Every measurement, every analysis, every theoretical framework has to be bulletproof. When corporate tries to discredit this, we need to have answers."

They worked in shifts over the next three days. Hassan focused on the geological analysis—dating, composition, structural assessment. Alexis handled the engineering aspects—material science, architectural analysis, power source speculation.

Yuki joined them on day two, brought in by Rivera with minimal explanation. She took one look at the footage and immediately began atmospheric modeling.

"If this structure had an atmosphere three billion years ago, we can estimate what Mars was like then," she said. "Temperature, pressure, chemical composition. It's a time capsule."

The paper grew. Twenty pages. Forty. Sixty.

Hassan wrote until his fingers cramped, then switched to voice dictation. Every finding documented. Every measurement recorded. Every conclusion supported by multiple independent data sources.

On hour sixty, Rivera appeared with coffee and sandwiches.

"How's it going?"

"We're close." Hassan rubbed his eyes. "Another ten hours should do it."

"You have twelve. I'm scheduling the transmission for 0800 tomorrow." Rivera set down the food. "I've also prepared a press statement. Short, factual, emphasizing the scientific significance. I'll release it five minutes after the data goes out."

"Corporate's going to lose their minds," Alexis said.

"Let them. By the time they mobilize a response, the story will be everywhere." Rivera pulled up the transmission queue. "I'm sending the full data package to seventeen universities, four space agencies, and thirty-eight independent research institutions. Corporate gets a summary and a courtesy heads-up thirty seconds before everyone else."

Hassan looked at the list. "You're declaring war."

"I'm doing my job. My job is to advance human knowledge, not protect corporate profit margins." Rivera headed for the door. "Finish the paper. Make it perfect. This is your legacy."

They worked through the night. At 0600, Hassan typed the final sentence of the conclusion and sat back.

Seventy-eight pages. Six hundred references. Complete documentation of humanity's first confirmed contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.

"It's done," he said.

Alexis read through the abstract one more time. "This is going to change everything."

"That's what we keep saying." Hassan packaged the files. "Think anyone will believe us?"

"The data doesn't care if they believe. It just is." Alexis transferred the package to Rivera. "And in two hours, it belongs to the world."

They sat in the lab, exhausted and wired on caffeine, waiting for 0800.

When Rivera's transmission executed, it happened in silence. No fanfare. No dramatic countdown. Just files streaming across millions of kilometers to Earth.

Twenty minutes later, the first responses started coming back. Academic institutions requesting additional data. Media outlets asking for interviews. And from corporate: a terse message demanding immediate explanation.

Rivera's response was equally terse: "Full report attached. Commander Rivera, Mars Colony Seven."

By hour twenty-four, the story was global news. Proof of alien civilization. Questions about what it meant for humanity. Debates about whether to send additional teams to Mars or protect the site.

And through it all, the data remained public. Accessible. Open.

Hassan watched the scientific community descend on their findings like hungry wolves. Papers analyzing their analysis. Critiques and confirmations. New theories building on their framework.

"We did it," he said.

Alexis pulled up the news feeds. "Now comes the hard part. Living with the consequences."

Corporate launched an investigation. Accused Rivera of mismanagement and unauthorized disclosure. Demanded her resignation.

She refused.

The crew rallied behind her. Formal letters of support. Testimonials about her leadership. Public statements about corporate overreach.

Earth Corporation backed down. Publicly, they couldn't afford to fire the commander who'd overseen humanity's greatest discovery. Privately, they made sure everyone knew she'd never work for them again.

Rivera didn't seem to care.

"Worth it," she told Alexis over drinks in the mess hall. "Some things are more important than careers."

Three weeks after the transmission, a message arrived from the International Space Agency.

They were sending a dedicated science team. Archaeologists, linguists, engineers. Twenty people with one mission: understand what Hassan and Alexis had found.

And they wanted Hassan and Alexis to lead the initial survey.

"Looks like you're not getting rid of this after all," Rivera said, forwarding the message.

Hassan read it twice. An official position. Full funding. Complete scientific autonomy.

Everything he'd wanted.

"I'll do it," he said. "But only if Alexis comes too."

Alexis looked up from her engineering reports. "Someone has to make sure you don't fall down any more alien holes."

"So that's a yes?"

"That's a yes."

They clinked coffee cups in a makeshift toast.

Three billion years ago, something had built a structure under the Martian surface and left it waiting.

Now, finally, someone was going to find out why.

The work was just beginning.

And Omar Hassan couldn't wait.
