Sarah Chen returned from her eighth jump to find she was younger than her daughter.

The medical bay confirmed it. Biological age: twenty-eight. Chronological age: thirty-four. Her daughter Maya, born six months before the jump program started, was now seven years old.

Sarah was four years younger than her own child.

"This is impossible," she said.

Dr. Yamamoto pulled up the cellular analysis. "Your body is de-aging during jumps. Not aging forward. The temporal displacement is running backwards for you specifically. We don't understand why."

"How long until I'm younger than zero?"

"Unknown. The regression isn't linear. Some jumps age you forward. Others reverse the process. The variance suggests quantum uncertainty in how your biology experiences time during transit." Yamamoto highlighted the data. "Sarah, you're becoming temporally unstable. Your age isn't fixed anymore. It fluctuates based on jump parameters we can't predict or control."

Sarah looked at her hands. Young hands. Unwrinkled. Uncalloused. Her wedding ring hung loose on fingers that had shrunk. Her daughter wouldn't recognize her. Her husband had filed separation papers three weeks ago, citing irreconcilable temporal differences.

She was losing everything to the jumps. And she couldn't stop.

"How many more jumps until I'm useful?" she asked.

"Sarah, you need to stop. The temporal instability is accelerating. Next jump might age you eighty years. Or de-age you to infancy. We can't predict." Yamamoto closed the files. "I'm recommending permanent grounding. Medical discharge. Full pension. Time to rest before your biology collapses entirely."

"Kowalski won't approve it. Not while the unknown fleet is still active."

"Kowalski doesn't have a choice. You're medically unfit for duty. Temporally unstable. One more jump could kill you. Or worse." Yamamoto met her eyes. "Sarah, you've done enough. More than enough. Let someone else carry this weight."

"There is no one else. I'm the only pilot with enough jump experience to handle the advanced maneuvers. Everyone else dies or goes insane after three jumps. I've done eight. I'm the only resource Kowalski has."

"You're a person. Not a resource."

Sarah laughed bitterly. "Tell that to the admiral. See how far it gets you."

She left the medical bay. Her quarters felt wrong. Too big. The furniture sized for someone older. Her clothes didn't fit. Her personal effects belonged to a woman who'd existed chronologically but might never exist biologically again.

Her comm chimed. Maya. Her daughter. Seven years old and dealing with a mother who kept getting younger every time she came home.

Sarah activated the video link. Maya's face appeared. Young. Confused. Hurt.

"Mom, why do you look different again?"

"The jumps change me, sweetie. We talked about this."

"I don't like it. I want my real mom back."

Sarah felt something break inside. "I am your real mom. I'm just... changing. But I'm still me inside."

"You don't look like you. Last time you looked like my big sister. Now you look like someone from my school." Maya's voice cracked. "Are you going to keep getting younger until you disappear?"

"I don't know."

"I hate the jumps. I hate the stupid ship. I hate that you keep leaving and coming back wrong." Maya wiped her eyes. "Dad says I'm not supposed to tell you this. But I don't want you to jump anymore. I want you to stay home and be my mom and stop changing."

"I can't, sweetie. People need me to—"

"I need you. I need my mom. The one who used to read me stories and make pancakes and not look like a teenager." Maya's voice rose. "But you care more about the stupid war than me. So go jump. Go get younger. Go disappear. I don't care anymore."

The link closed. Sarah sat in the dark quarters, staring at the blank screen.

Her daughter hated her. Her husband had left. Her own body was betraying her one jump at a time.

And Kowalski wanted her to jump again tomorrow.

She pulled up the mission brief. Deep reconnaissance. Five consecutive jumps. High temporal displacement expected. Estimated biological variance: plus or minus fifteen years.

She could emerge fifty years old. Or thirteen. Or anywhere in between.

There was no way to predict. No way to control it. Just jump and hope her biology survived the chaos.

Sarah looked at the photo on her desk. Her family. Taken before the jump program started. When she was thirty-four and looked it. When Maya was an infant and her husband still smiled. When time moved forward like it was supposed to.

She picked up the photo. Studied the faces. Tried to remember feeling that stable. That certain.

That human.

Her comm chimed again. Kowalski. Requesting immediate presence in his office.

Sarah dressed in her uniform. It hung loose on her younger frame. Made her look like a child playing soldier.

Kowalski's office was austere. Military. Focused. The admiral looked up as she entered.

"Lieutenant Chen. Dr. Yamamoto submitted your medical evaluation. He recommends grounding."

"Yes, sir."

"Do you agree with his assessment?"

Sarah thought about Maya. About her marriage. About her body aging and de-aging chaotically through time. About the price she'd paid for eight jumps and the price the ninth would exact.

"No, sir. I'm fit for duty."

Kowalski studied her. "You look sixteen. Your daughter is seven. That's a biological impossibility that violates every understanding of temporal mechanics."

"Yes, sir. But I'm still the best jump pilot you have. The only one who can handle the advanced maneuvers without dying or going insane."

"At what cost, Lieutenant? You're losing yourself one jump at a time. Your family. Your identity. Your temporal stability. There has to be a limit."

"The limit is when I'm dead or useless. Until then, I jump." Sarah met his eyes. "Sir, I know what the jumps are doing to me. I know what I'm losing. But I also know what's at stake. The unknown fleet. Earth's defense. Humanity's future. If I have to sacrifice my personal timeline to protect that, I will."

"That's not sacrifice. That's suicide. Temporal suicide." Kowalski leaned back. "Sarah, I'm a military commander. I've ordered people into situations that killed them. Made peace with that necessity. But I've never ordered someone to erase their own existence. And I won't start now."

"You're not ordering me. I'm volunteering."

"You're a mother. A wife. A person with a life beyond the military. Don't throw that away for a war that might already be won."

"Might is the problem, sir. We don't know. And until we do, I have to keep jumping. Someone has to." Sarah pulled up the mission brief. "Five jumps. Deep reconnaissance. High risk. I can do this. Let me do this."

Kowalski was quiet for a long time. Then he pulled up her service record. Eight successful jumps. Zero failures. More experience than any living pilot.

"One condition," he said finally. "You take a neural recorder. Full consciousness backup. If the temporal displacement erases you, if you de-age past birth or age past death, at least your mind survives. We can rebuild you. Clone a new body. Restore your consciousness. You won't be the same. But you'll exist."

"That's not survival. That's copying."

"It's better than nothing. And it's the only way I authorize this mission." Kowalski's expression was hard. "Take the recorder or stand down. Those are your options."

Sarah thought about it. A copy of her mind in a new body. Not quite her. Not quite real. But alive in some sense. Able to see Maya grow up. Able to remember what it was like to be human before the jumps broke her timeline.

"Okay. I'll take the recorder."

Kowalski nodded. "Mission launches in eighteen hours. Use that time wisely. Say goodbye to your daughter. Just in case the next jumps make that impossible."

Sarah left the office. The corridors felt longer somehow. Emptier.

She pulled up her comm and dialed Maya. The call went to voicemail.

"Hey sweetie. It's Mom. I know you're mad at me. I know I keep changing. I know this is hard." Sarah's voice cracked. "But I want you to know I love you. No matter how old I look. No matter how much time gets weird. I'm still your mom. And I always will be. Even if... even if the next jumps change me too much to come back."

She paused. Wondered what else to say. Wondered if this was the last message her daughter would receive from the mother she remembered.

"Be good, Maya. Take care of your dad. And remember—time is strange. But love isn't. Love stays constant even when everything else shifts. I love you. Always."

She closed the comm. Wiped her eyes. Headed for her quarters to pack.

Eighteen hours until launch. Five jumps that might age her forward or backwards or sideways through dimensions of time humans weren't meant to experience.

She was terrified. But she was also committed.

Because someone had to jump. Someone had to risk temporal annihilation to protect humanity.

And Sarah Chen, biological age twenty-eight, chronological age thirty-four, mother of a seven-year-old daughter, was still the best pilot they had.

Even if she disappeared one jump at a time.
