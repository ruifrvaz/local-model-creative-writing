Engineer Malik found the crack during routine hull inspection. Section 47, starboard side. Structural composite showing stress fractures that spread like frost across metal.

He reported it immediately.

Captain Reyes arrived with Dr. Eva Sato and Structural Engineer Nguyen. They studied the crack in silence.

"How bad?" Reyes asked.

Nguyen ran diagnostic scans. "The fracture extends eight meters along the hull. It's not penetrating yet, but it's degrading the structural integrity. Another twenty years of accumulated stress and we're looking at potential hull breach."

"Twenty years is two generations."

"Exactly. This ship was built for a four-hundred-year journey. We're only two hundred years in. The hull shouldn't be showing fatigue for another century."

Eva pulled up the construction records. "The Covenant was built fast. Earth was facing environmental collapse—they rushed the timeline. Maybe quality control wasn't what it should've been."

"Or maybe the original engineers underestimated the cumulative stress of multi-generational spaceflight," Malik suggested. "The micro-meteor impacts, radiation exposure, thermal cycling. Two hundred years of constant stress."

Reyes studied the crack. "Can we repair it?"

"Temporarily. We can reinforce with composite patches. But if there's one crack, there might be others." Nguyen pulled up the hull schematics. "We need comprehensive inspection of every structural section."

The survey took two weeks. Teams of engineers crawling through every accessible section of the ten-kilometer hull.

They found seventeen more cracks. Some minor. Some approaching critical.

The Covenant was showing its age.

Nguyen compiled the data into a disturbing report. "The hull is fatigued. Not catastrophically, but measurably. We can patch the current fractures, but new ones will develop. We're in a race against structural degradation."

"Prognosis?" Reyes asked.

"If degradation continues at current rates, we've got seventy to ninety years before hull integrity becomes critical. Maybe less if we encounter unforeseen stresses."

Malik did the math. Seventy years put them still decades away from Kepler-442c. They'd voted to divert to the new destination, but if the ship couldn't survive the journey, the vote was meaningless.

"What are our options?" Reyes asked.

"Aggressive maintenance. Reinforce every identified fracture. Monitor for new stress points. Potentially slow our velocity to reduce impact stresses." Nguyen highlighted the critical sections. "But that extends the journey time."

"How much slower?"

"Ten percent velocity reduction adds twenty years to the journey. But it could buy us the structural margin we need."

Twenty years. An entire generation added to the voyage. Children who would've seen Kepler-442c reaching adulthood on the ship instead.

Reyes called a council session.

The debate was fierce. The Settlers who'd voted to divert to Kepler-442c argued they'd already compromised the original mission—slowing down was just extending the misery. The Continuers who'd wanted to maintain course to Tau Ceti saw the slowdown as validation of their concerns.

"We're asking an entire generation to give up planet-fall," one representative argued. "People who thought they'd reach Kepler-442c in their lifetimes would die in transit instead."

"Better to die in transit than have the ship collapse three decades from arrival," another countered. "Hull integrity isn't negotiable."

Malik listened from the gallery. Both sides had valid points. The mathematics didn't care about politics.

Eva stood to speak. "I've spent my life preserving Earth's culture for future generations. Making sure our descendants know where they came from. But that only matters if there are descendants."

She pulled up historical records. Images of the Covenant's construction. Earth visible in the background—blue and fragile and dying.

"Our ancestors built this ship in desperation. They didn't have time for perfect engineering. They built what they could and trusted us to maintain it." Eva gestured at the hull diagrams. "Those cracks are our inheritance. Our responsibility. We fix them or we fail everyone who came before and everyone who'll come after."

The vote passed. Velocity reduction of ten percent. Twenty years added to the journey. Aggressive hull maintenance protocols implemented immediately.

Malik was assigned to the main reinforcement crew. They started with the worst fractures—welding composite patches, reinforcing load-bearing sections, monitoring for expansion.

The work was tedious and exhausting. Twelve-hour shifts in pressure suits, working in the void with the hull stretching endlessly in every direction.

But it was necessary.

During one shift, Malik worked alongside a young engineer named Aria. First-generation, born on the ship. She'd been training as an engineer since childhood, learning the systems that kept eight thousand people alive.

"My parents thought they'd reach Kepler-442c," Aria said, welding a reinforcement strut. "The vote gave them hope. Now the slowdown takes that away."

"The slowdown keeps the ship intact. That's worth the extra time."

"Easy to say when you're Covenant-born. This ship is all you know. But my parents remember Earth. They dream of walking on solid ground. Every year in transit is another year they might not live to see planet-fall."

Malik had no answer to that. The mathematics of hull stress were straightforward. The mathematics of human hope were impossible.

They worked in silence, reinforcing the section of hull that would carry humanity toward an uncertain future.

Three months into the maintenance program, they'd repaired all seventeen identified cracks. Nguyen ran new surveys.

And found twelve more.

"The hull isn't just aging," he reported. "It's accelerating. Each repair creates new stress points. We're playing whack-a-mole with structural failure."

"Then we hit harder," Reyes said. "Double the maintenance crews. Triple the inspection frequency. We stay ahead of the degradation."

"That diverts personnel from other critical functions."

"Nothing is more critical than hull integrity."

The crew adapted. Scientists spent half their time on maintenance. Agricultural specialists learned basic welding. Even administrators took shifts inspecting hull sections.

The Covenant became a ship perpetually under repair.

Malik found Eva in the Archive one evening. She was reviewing construction footage, watching the Covenant take shape in Earth orbit.

"Looking for something specific?" he asked.

"Understanding. Why they built it this way. Whether they knew it wouldn't last." Eva replayed a segment showing the hull assembly. "Look at the schedule pressure. They're installing sections before previous welds are properly cured. Rushing to meet deadlines."

"Earth was collapsing. They didn't have time for perfection."

"No. They had time for survival." Eva paused the footage. "They built what they could and trusted us to handle the consequences. That's not negligence. That's faith."

Malik studied the image. Workers in pressure suits, welding the hull that would carry their children's children across light-years.

"Do you think we'll make it?" he asked. "To Kepler-442c?"

"I think we'll try. That's what the people who built this ship did. Tried against impossible odds." Eva smiled slightly. "We're their legacy. We honor them by continuing the attempt."

The hull maintenance became routine. Eternal vigilance against structural decay. Every crack patched. Every stress point monitored.

The ship slowed. Velocity reduced by ten percent. The journey extended by twenty years.

Aria's parents aged. They would not live to see Kepler-442c. That knowledge settled on them like weight.

But the ship remained intact.

The cracks were held at bay.

Eight thousand souls sailed through the void in a vessel that was slowly falling apart and constantly being rebuilt.

It wasn't the journey anyone had planned.

But it was the journey they had.

And they would see it through.

One weld at a time.
