Commander Rivera stared at the transmission from Earth Corporation and felt her jaw tighten.

"They're cutting our budget by thirty percent."

Alexis Kwan looked up from the maintenance report she'd been reviewing. "I'm sorry, what?"

"Budget cuts. Effective immediately." Rivera pushed the tablet across her desk. "Delayed equipment shipments, reduced crew rotations, and—this is the best part—we're expected to maintain current productivity targets."

Alexis scanned the document. Rivera watched her face cycle through disbelief, anger, and finally a cold professional calm that somehow made Rivera feel better. At least she wasn't the only one who wanted to throw something.

"This is insane," Alexis said. "We're already operating on minimal margins. Cut us further and we're one equipment failure away from total system collapse."

"I'm aware."

"Did you tell them that?"

"I told them. Corporate's response was to 'optimize resource utilization and demonstrate lean operational efficiency.'" Rivera's voice dripped acid on the corporate jargon. "Translation: figure it out and stop complaining."

Alexis set the tablet down carefully. Too carefully. "Commander, I need to be clear about something. If we cut maintenance schedules to save money, people will die. Not might die. Will die."

"I know."

"Do they know? Does anyone back on Earth actually understand what we're dealing with up here?"

Rivera stood and moved to the window. Beyond the triple-paned glass, Mars stretched red and barren to the horizon. Beautiful. Deadly. Unforgiving of mistakes.

"They know," she said quietly. "They just don't care. We're a line item on a balance sheet. The publicity value of 'First Permanent Mars Colony' is dropping. Investors are getting nervous. Stock prices are declining."

"So they're cutting life support to boost quarterly earnings."

"Welcome to corporate space exploration." Rivera turned back. "Here's the situation. We have two choices. We can file a formal protest through official channels, which will take months to process and almost certainly be denied. Or we can adapt."

"Adapt how? We can't create spare parts out of Martian dust."

"No. But we can prioritize differently." Rivera pulled up the colony's resource allocation chart. "We've been running everything by the book—Earth protocols, safety margins, redundant systems. What if we stopped doing that?"

Alexis leaned forward. "You're talking about violating safety standards."

"I'm talking about writing new standards. Mars standards. Based on what we've learned actually works here, not what some committee on Earth thinks should work." Rivera highlighted several systems. "We've been maintaining Earth-level redundancy on non-critical systems. Meanwhile, critical systems are held together with improvised fixes because we don't have budget for proper repairs."

"So we reallocate. Put everything into life support, power, and structural integrity. Let the nice-to-haves degrade."

"Exactly." Rivera pulled up a proposal she'd been working on. "I want to form a committee—you, Hassan, Yuki, and Marcus Webb."

"Webb? He's the corporate liaison. He's the one enforcing these cuts."

"Which is why we need him. If we're going to rewrite the operational playbook, we need someone who understands how to sell it to Earth." Rivera met Alexis's skeptical gaze. "I don't like it either. But Webb knows how corporations think. We give him something that sounds good in a shareholder report, he gives us the flexibility to actually survive."

Alexis was quiet for a moment. "You're asking me to work with the man whose cost-cutting almost killed us last week."

"I'm asking you to use him. Big difference."

"And if he says no?"

"Then we go over his head. But I'd rather have him inside the tent than outside." Rivera closed the file. "First meeting is tomorrow, 0800. I want proposals for a new operational framework that cuts costs without cutting throats."

"That's a narrow line."

"Mars is full of narrow lines. We walk them every day." Rivera pulled up the crew roster. "I'm also implementing mandatory cross-training. Everyone learns at least two critical specialties. If we lose someone, we can't afford to lose their expertise with them."

"That will cut into productivity."

"Short term. Long term, it makes us more resilient." Rivera highlighted another section. "And I'm reducing research time. We're a colony, not a science outpost anymore. The mission has to shift from discovery to survival."

Alexis absorbed that. "Hassan's not going to like it."

"Hassan can publish his papers after we make sure there's still a colony to publish from." Rivera softened slightly. "Look, I know this is hard. We all came here for the science, the exploration, the dream of expanding humanity's reach. But dreams don't keep people alive. Systems do. Discipline does. And right now, we need to focus on the fundamentals."

"Water, air, power, food."

"And shelter. And safety. And each other." Rivera stood. "Get me your proposals by tomorrow morning. We'll hammer out the details as a committee. But Alexis? I need you to be honest with me. Can we make this work?"

Alexis looked at the budget numbers again. Her face was unreadable.

"We can make it work," she said finally. "But it's going to hurt. We'll have to sacrifice things we don't want to sacrifice. Make compromises that feel like failures."

"I'm familiar with compromise." Rivera thought of the recruitment speech she'd given, back when the colony was just a proposal. All the promises about building a better future, advancing science, securing humanity's place in the cosmos.

None of those speeches had mentioned budget cuts and corporate politics.

"One more thing," Alexis said. "If we're rewriting the operational framework, I want final authority on all engineering decisions. No corporate overrides on safety equipment. No substituting local materials without my approval."

"Done. Put it in writing and I'll sign it tonight."

Alexis nodded and stood. "Then we'll make it work. Somehow."

After she left, Rivera sat in the quiet of her office and allowed herself thirty seconds of doubt. Thirty seconds to wonder if she was making the right call. If there was some other option she hadn't considered.

Then she pulled up the crew files and began planning the cross-training schedules.

Doubt was a luxury. Mars didn't offer many of those.

Her comm chimed. Webb, requesting a meeting.

Rivera took a breath and accepted. "Marcus. Come on in."

He entered, tablet in hand, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. Good. That made two of them.

"I saw the budget notification," he said.

"Then you know we need to talk."

Webb sat. "Commander, I want to be clear—I didn't ask for these cuts. I fought against them. But headquarters was adamant."

"I'm sure they were." Rivera kept her voice neutral. "Here's what's going to happen. Tomorrow morning, you're going to meet with my senior staff. We're going to draft a new operational plan that meets your budget constraints without getting anyone killed. And you're going to help us sell it to corporate."

"And if the plan violates Earth safety standards?"

"Then we'll write new standards. Mars standards." Rivera leaned forward. "Marcus, I'm going to be blunt. Corporate sent you here to make sure we stay profitable. I'm telling you right now: the most unprofitable thing that could happen is a catastrophic failure that kills this colony. The publicity would be disastrous. The lawsuits would be worse."

Webb's expression shifted. He was following the logic.

"So help us build something sustainable," Rivera continued. "Help us create a model that actually works for Mars. And when corporate asks how we're cutting costs, you can tell them we're 'pioneering innovative resource optimization strategies.' They'll love that."

"And we'll have kept people alive."

"Exactly." Rivera pulled up her proposal. "I need you on my side for this, Marcus. Can you do that?"

Webb studied the documents. Rivera could see him calculating angles, weighing options, trying to find the path that satisfied both his conscience and his corporate masters.

"I can do that," he said finally. "But I need something from you. When this works—and it had better work—I need you to go on record praising corporate's flexible approach to operational challenges."

"You want me to give them credit."

"I want you to give them cover. Make them look smart for letting us innovate. Give them a win they can show investors."

Rivera felt disgust rise but pushed it down. This was the game. Politics and appearances and managing fragile egos back on Earth.

"Done. We all get to pretend we're heroes."

"Better than the alternative." Webb stood. "I'll see you tomorrow at 0800."

After he left, Rivera pulled up the Earth transmission again and read through it one more time. The bureaucratic language. The impossible demands. The casual disregard for the realities of living on Mars.

She drafted a response. Professional. Measured. Acknowledging the budget constraints and promising full cooperation.

Not a single word about how angry she was. How betrayed the crew would feel. How close to the edge they were already running.

That was her job. Absorb the pressure from above. Protect the crew below. Make impossible decisions and live with the consequences.

Rivera sent the message and shut down her terminal.

Tomorrow they'd start rebuilding everything from the ground up.

Tonight, she'd allow herself one drink and a few moments of honest fury.

Then back to work.

Mars didn't wait for anyone to feel ready.
