Alexis Kwan stood at the drill site and watched the cavity breach with something between terror and wonder.

The drill bit punched through the final meter of rock. Pressurized air hissed from the opening. And then, slowly, something else emerged.

Light. Blue-green light that shouldn't exist underground.

"Chen, are you seeing this?" Alexis activated her helmet recorder.

"Seeing it. Not believing it." Chen's voice crackled through the comm. "That's bioluminescence. Or something like it."

Omar Hassan appeared beside her, instruments already scanning. "Electromagnetic signature is off the scale. Whatever's down there is generating its own power field."

Commander Rivera's voice cut through the channel. "Status report. What are we dealing with?"

"Unknown, Commander. But it's active. Alive, maybe. Or at least powered."

"Pull back. Establish perimeter. Nobody enters that cavity until we have proper protocols."

Alexis wanted to argue. They'd spent weeks drilling to this point. Slow, careful approach to avoid damaging whatever was inside. Now they were supposed to walk away?

But Rivera was right. They had no idea what they'd found.

The crew retreated to safe distance. Alexis set up monitoring equipment—cameras, sensors, atmospheric samplers. Everything pointed at the breach.

The light intensified. Blue-green became pure white. Then spectrum shifted toward ultraviolet.

"It's responding to exposure," Omar said. "Like waking up."

"Or getting angry," Chen muttered.

The cavity's electromagnetic pulse strengthened. Alexis felt it through her suit's sensors. A rhythm. Point-eight-seven hertz. The same pulse they'd detected from the surface.

But stronger now. Insistent.

"Commander, the EM pulse is increasing. Recommend we—"

Light exploded from the cavity. Not explosion—emergence. A beam of pure energy that shot into the Martian sky.

Every alarm on Alexis's suit screamed. She hit the deck, pulling Omar down with her. The beam lasted three seconds. Then cut off, leaving afterimages burned into her retinas.

"Everyone okay?" Rivera's voice.

Affirmatives came through the channel. Shaken but alive.

Alexis pulled herself up and looked at the cavity. The light had dimmed to a gentle glow. The EM pulse had dropped to baseline levels.

"What the hell was that?" Chen asked.

"A signal," Omar said. He was staring at his instruments. "That beam wasn't random. It was directed. Precise trajectory. And it was modulated."

"Modulated how?"

"Like a transmission. Carrier wave with encoded data."

Alexis felt reality shift. They hadn't just found a cavity. They'd found something that communicated.

"Commander, we need to analyze that transmission," she said.

"Agreed. But from safe distance. Everyone back to base. We reassess before approaching again."

The crew packed their equipment and retreated. Alexis kept her eyes on the cavity. The glow was steady now. Patient.

Like it was waiting.

Back at the hab, Rivera assembled the senior staff. The transmission data was already being analyzed.

"Omar, what have you got?" Rivera asked.

Omar pulled up the spectral analysis. "The beam was coherent light—essentially a laser. But the modulation is complex. Prime number sequences. Mathematical constants. And something else I can't decode yet."

"It's trying to communicate," Dr. Patel said.

"Or it's automated. A beacon that activates when exposed to air." Alexis pulled up the cavity's structure. "We don't know if there's intelligence behind this. Could be ancient technology running on autopilot."

"Ancient or not, we just activated something that's been dormant for potentially millions of years," Rivera said. "We need to decide our next move carefully."

Yuki spoke up. "Do we report to Earth?"

"We have to. This is first contact protocols. Earth needs to know."

"Earth will classify it," Chen said. "Send specialists who'll take over. We'll lose any chance to study this properly."

Rivera met his eyes. "That's not our decision. We're colonists, not first contact team."

"We're the people who found it. That should count for something."

"It counts for duty to report. Not duty to investigate beyond our capabilities."

Alexis understood both positions. This was the discovery of a lifetime. Potentially the discovery of human history. But they were also in over their heads.

"What if we do both?" she said. "Report to Earth. But continue observation. Document everything. By the time specialists arrive, we'll have data they can use."

Rivera considered. "Controlled observation. No direct contact. No attempts to enter the cavity. Just monitoring and documentation."

"Agreed."

The message to Earth went out. Full report on the cavity. The transmission. The implications.

The response came eighteen hours later. Not from corporate. From the Colonial Authority. Director Kaufman himself.

"Commander Rivera. Your discovery has been classified at the highest level. A specialist team is being assembled. ETA sixty days. Until then, maintain observation but do not approach within fifty meters of the cavity. Do not attempt communication. Do not reveal findings to anyone outside your senior staff. Kaufman out."

Sixty days. Two months of watching and waiting while something potentially alien sat in a hole on Mars.

Alexis pulled up the monitoring feeds. The cavity's glow had stabilized. The EM pulse continued its steady rhythm. Point-eight-seven hertz. Like a heartbeat.

Or a countdown.

"What do you think it is?" Yuki asked.

Alexis had been asking herself the same question. "Something old. Something powerful. And something that wanted to be found."

"Why?"

"That's what scares me. We don't know if activating it was good or bad. We just know we did it."

The colony settled into routine. Surface operations continued. But everyone's attention kept drifting to the monitoring feeds. The cavity's patient glow. The steady pulse.

On day three, Omar detected a change. "The EM signature is shifting. Still point-eight-seven hertz, but the amplitude is increasing."

"Is it getting stronger?"

"Or preparing for another transmission."

They watched. Waited. The pulse climbed steadily over the next six hours.

Then stopped. Held at exactly twice the original amplitude.

"It's doubling," Omar said. "Like it's showing us a pattern."

"Or escalating," Chen said.

Forty-eight hours later, the pulse doubled again. Then again after another forty-eight hours.

Alexis plotted the progression. "It's geometric. Each doubling happens in half the time of the previous one. If this continues—"

"We'll hit critical levels in thirty-two days," Omar finished. "Right before the specialists arrive."

Rivera pulled up the Colonial Authority protocols. "We're supposed to maintain observation only. But if this thing is building to another energy discharge—"

"We evacuate," Alexis said. "Get everyone clear before it goes critical."

"And lose the colony we spent six months building."

"Better than losing the crew."

The debate raged through the senior staff. Stay and observe. Evacuate and preserve lives. Try to shut down whatever was happening in the cavity.

Alexis returned to the drill site. The cavity's glow was brighter now. The pulse was stronger. And somewhere deep below the Martian surface, something ancient was waking up.

She thought about the transmission. The mathematical sequences. The precise targeting.

It wasn't random. It was purposeful.

Something down there wanted to be heard.

The question was whether humanity was ready to listen.

Or whether listening would be the last mistake they ever made.

Alexis activated her recorder. "Personal log. Day thirty-seven of the colony. We've activated something on Mars. Something that's been waiting a very long time. I don't know if it's a gift or a weapon. But in twenty-five days, we're going to find out."

She closed the log and returned to base.

Above her, in the thin Martian atmosphere, stars shone cold and distant.

And below, in the dark, something pulsed with patient inevitability.

Waiting.
