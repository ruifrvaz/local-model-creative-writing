Ambassador Chen Wu found the bomber in the last place he'd expected.

The meditation garden. A small space near the station's observation deck where diplomats went to escape the endless negotiations. Peaceful. Quiet. Filled with synthetic plants and recycled water features.

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo sat on a bench, watching the tracking display on her tablet.

"You lied about hunting the bomber," Chen said. "You are the bomber."

Okonkwo looked up. Her expression was calm. Resigned. "I planted the devices. Yes. But I'm not hunting anyone. I'm waiting."

"For what? The bombs to detonate? Eight thousand people to die?"

"For someone to understand why." Okonkwo gestured at the empty bench. "Sit, Ambassador. Let me explain before you call security."

Chen activated his concealed comm, setting it to record. Then sat. "You have two minutes."

"The peace talks are a lie. Both sides are using them as cover. Buying time to position forces. Preparing for the real war." Okonkwo pulled up classified files on her tablet. "I'm Coalition medical staff. I see the casualty projections. The bioweapon research. The plans for total annihilation of Frontier populations. The Coalition isn't negotiating peace. They're preparing genocide."

"That's speculation."

"That's documented fact. Look at the files. Casualty estimates in the billions. Deployment timelines. Resource allocation for planetary bombardment." Okonkwo's voice was steady. Professional. Hiding rage underneath. "The Frontier is preparing similar measures. Mutual assured destruction on a scale that makes historical wars look like skirmishes."

Chen scanned the files. His blood ran cold. The projections were real. Detailed. Horrifying.

"Why bomb the station?" he asked. "Why kill innocents to stop it?"

"Because the innocents are enabling it. The diplomats negotiating in bad faith. The merchants profiting from war materiel. The civilians who close their eyes to what's being done in their names." Okonkwo gestured at the station. "Eight thousand people living on neutral ground. Pretending they're above the conflict. But they're not. They're part of it. Participants in a system that's about to commit species-level genocide."

"So you kill them to stop it?"

"I threaten to kill them. Force them to confront what they're enabling. Make them choose between peace and annihilation." Okonkwo pulled up the bomb timers. Forty-seven hours remaining. "If the talks produce real peace—verifiable disarmament, third-party enforcement, mutual transparency—I disarm the bombs. Everyone lives. But if the talks fail, if the delegates walk away preparing for war, the station dies. And maybe that sacrifice saves billions."

Chen felt sick. "That's terrorism. Using fear to coerce political outcomes."

"That's warfare. What do you think the Coalition and Frontier are doing? Except they're threatening billions instead of thousands. And they're doing it quietly. Behind diplomatic language. While I'm at least honest about the stakes." Okonkwo met his eyes. "Ambassador, you know I'm right. You've seen the same files. You know the talks are theater. The real decisions are being made by military commanders preparing final solutions."

Chen wanted to argue. To deny it. But she was right. He'd seen the troop movements. The weapons development. The casual discussions of acceptable casualty ratios that treated human lives as statistical noise.

"There has to be another way," he said.

"Name one. Diplomacy has failed. Sanctions have failed. Appeals to shared humanity have failed. The Coalition and Frontier have decided that genocide is preferable to coexistence. So I'm forcing a different choice—peace or mutual annihilation starts here. On this station. With people they can see dying instead of abstract populations they can ignore."

"You're insane."

"I'm desperate. There's a difference." Okonkwo pulled up the casualty projections again. "Three billion dead in the Coalition population centers. Two billion in the Frontier colonies. Estimates assume conventional warfare. Bioweapons double those numbers. Chemical weapons triple them. And both sides are developing all three simultaneously."

Chen read the files with growing horror. "How did you get this information?"

"I'm medical staff. I see the bioweapon test results. The infection rates. The mortality curves. I write the reports estimating how fast diseases will spread through orbital habitats and planet-side populations." Okonkwo's voice cracked. "I'm part of it, Ambassador. Part of the genocide machine. And I can't stop it alone. But maybe I can shock people into stopping it themselves."

"By threatening to blow up a neutral station."

"By proving that neutrality is a lie. That everyone's complicit. That standing aside while genocide is prepared makes you as guilty as the people ordering it." Okonkwo closed the files. "Call security if you want. Arrest me. Disarm the bombs. Let the genocide proceed. At least you'll be comfortable knowing you maintained diplomatic propriety while billions died."

Chen sat in silence. Processing. Calculating. Trying to find the moral high ground in a situation that had none.

"What's your real endgame?" he asked finally. "You can't actually want the station to die."

"I want the talks to succeed. I want verifiable peace. I want the bioweapons destroyed and the war plans scrapped and mutual disarmament enforced." Okonkwo looked at the meditation garden. At the fake plants and artificial peace. "I want the impossible. So I'm using impossible methods."

"You'll fail. The delegates won't be coerced into genuine peace. They'll resent the threat. Harden their positions. Use your bombs as justification for military action."

"Maybe. Or maybe they'll see what I see—that we're all dead anyway unless something changes. That neutral ground is still ground. That standing aside doesn't save you when the war comes." Okonkwo stood. "I gave the delegates seventy-two hours. Forty-seven remain. Either they produce a real peace treaty or everyone on this station learns what the next war feels like. Up close. Personal. Unavoidable."

Chen stood as well. "I'm going to stop you."

"Then you'd better work fast. And you'd better be right about diplomacy being able to save billions. Because if you're wrong, if the talks fail and the war starts, my bombs will look merciful compared to what's coming."

She walked away. Chen watched her go. Then activated his comm.

"Lena, I found the bomber. It's Okonkwo. And it's worse than we thought."

He spent the next hour briefing Director Nkrumah. Showing the classified files. Explaining Okonkwo's logic. Her desperation. Her terrible mathematics that balanced eight thousand lives against billions.

"What do you recommend?" Nkrumah asked.

"Make the talks real. Force both sides to actual negotiations. Verifiable disarmament. Third-party enforcement. Real peace instead of theater." Chen pulled up the treaty framework. "We have forty-seven hours. If we can produce a genuine agreement, Okonkwo disarms the bombs. Everyone lives. And maybe, just maybe, the genocide gets prevented."

"And if we can't?"

"Then we disarm the bombs by force and pray Okonkwo was wrong about the war." Chen looked at the casualty projections. "But I don't think she is. I think we're watching two civilizations prepare mutual annihilation. And this station is the only place left where people might choose differently."

Nkrumah was quiet for a long time. Then he activated station-wide comm.

"All delegates, this is Director Nkrumah. We have a crisis situation that requires your immediate attention. Assemble in the council chamber. Now. What you learn there will determine whether eight thousand people survive the week. And whether billions survive the year."

The delegates assembled. Chen presented the evidence. The bioweapons. The genocide plans. The bombs throughout the station.

Some delegates denied it. Some blamed the other side. Some threatened to leave immediately.

But some—a few—looked at the data and understood.

This was the moment. The choice point. The last chance to step back from the abyss.

Forty-seven hours to peace. Or annihilation.

Chen Wu, career diplomat, stood at the center and hoped humanity still had enough wisdom to choose survival.

Even when the cost was admitting how close they'd come to destroying themselves.
