The drill bit screamed through Martian rock at two meters per hour. Alexis watched the depth gauge tick upward and did the math. Thirty-eight more hours until they reached the cavity.

Thirty-eight hours until they'd know if Hassan's theory was right.

The drill was positioned three meters from the original borehole, angled to intercept the tunnel Hassan's imaging had revealed. If his calculations were correct, they'd break through just above the connecting passage.

If he was wrong, they'd drill forty meters into solid rock and have nothing to show but wasted time and equipment.

"Depth check," Hassan called from the monitoring station.

"Two point four meters. On schedule." Alexis adjusted the drill's angle slightly. "How's the imaging look?"

"Clear. No unexpected voids or stress fractures." Hassan zoomed in on the subsurface scan. "The tunnel is definitely there. We should hit it at thirty-nine point six meters."

Alexis marked the projection on her display. "And if there's anything waiting on the other side?"

"Then we find out what it is." Hassan's voice carried equal parts excitement and terror. Alexis understood the feeling.

They were drilling into something that hadn't been disturbed for longer than humans had existed. Whatever was down there had been sealed since before Earth's dinosaurs walked. Before Earth's complex life, even.

The weight of that pressed on her as the drill churned deeper.

Sofia Reyes arrived with the ladder sections they'd fabricated. "These are rated for Martian gravity and temperature extremes. Should be good for whatever you find down there."

"Should be?"

"Well, I can't exactly test them against three-billion-year-old alien architecture." Sofia grinned. "But they're overbuilt by a factor of three. You'd have to work pretty hard to break them."

"Famous last words." Alexis helped unload the sections. "How's the atmospheric testing gear coming?"

"Ready. We've got sensors for everything from oxygen levels to exotic radiation. If there's something weird down there, we'll know before you stick your head in."

Alexis appreciated the thoroughness. Sofia might joke, but her engineering was solid.

The drill ran continuously, stopping only for bit changes and cooling cycles. Alexis worked in shifts with Hassan and a rotating crew of technicians, monitoring progress and adjusting parameters.

At fifteen meters, they hit a layer of compressed basalt that slowed progress to a crawl. Alexis adjusted the drill speed and hoped the bit would hold.

At twenty-three meters, a pressure sensor spiked.

"We've got atmosphere," Hassan said, voice tight. "Thin, but measurable."

Alexis checked the readings. Point zero three bar. Almost nothing, but definitely not vacuum.

"Composition?"

"Analyzing." Hassan pulled up the spectrometer data. "Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, trace argon. Similar to Martian surface atmosphere but... wait."

"What?"

"There's helium-3. Significant quantities." Hassan looked up. "That doesn't occur naturally in these concentrations. Not on Mars."

Alexis felt a chill. Helium-3 was rare, valuable, and usually found in association with fusion reactions or cosmic ray bombardment.

"Could be residual from ancient solar wind."

"At this depth? Forty meters down?" Hassan shook his head. "No. This is from something else."

They stared at each other. Both thinking the same thing, neither wanting to say it aloud.

The drill kept grinding deeper.

At thirty-five meters, they installed the first support ring. The shaft was holding well—solid rock, stable, no signs of collapse. Alexis ran structural tests every meter, paranoid about cave-ins.

Mars had tried to kill her enough times already. She wasn't giving it another chance.

At thirty-eight point one meters, the drill bit suddenly lurched forward.

"Stop!" Hassan's shout cut through the noise.

Alexis killed the drill. "What is it?"

"We're through. The bit just broke into open space." Hassan pulled up the depth sensor. "Thirty-eight point two meters. We hit the tunnel."

They'd done it.

Alexis activated the shaft camera and lowered it into the opening. The feed showed darkness, then a curved surface reflecting light.

Metal.

Not rock. Not natural formation. Metal.

"Oh my God," Sofia breathed.

The camera revealed a cylindrical tunnel approximately two meters in diameter, walls smooth and regular. The metal—if that's what it was—showed no signs of corrosion or degradation.

Three billion years in Martian soil, and it looked fresh.

"Hassan, are you seeing this?"

"I'm seeing it. I don't believe it, but I'm seeing it." Hassan's hands were shaking as he recorded the feed. "That's technology. Advanced technology. On Mars."

Alexis pulled the camera back and checked structural integrity. The tunnel walls registered as solid, no obvious weak points.

"I'm going down."

"What? No. We agreed to do atmospheric testing first, structural surveys, risk assessment—"

"Screw the timeline. There's a tunnel down there made of metal that shouldn't exist. I need to see it with my own eyes." Alexis was already pulling on her pressure suit.

"Alexis, wait—"

"Hassan, we have one chance at this before corporate finds out and takes over. One chance to see what's down there on our terms." She sealed her helmet. "I'm taking that chance. You can come with me or stay up here. Your choice."

Hassan looked at Sofia. "Tell Rivera we're going down. If we're not back in two hours, seal the shaft."

"You're both insane."

"Probably." Hassan suited up. "But we're going anyway."

Alexis attached the first ladder section to the shaft and began the climb down. The suit was bulky, the ladder narrow, but she'd worked in worse conditions.

The descent took twenty minutes. The shaft walls were rough Martian rock, lit by her helmet lamp. Then, at thirty-eight meters, everything changed.

The tunnel.

Alexis clipped her safety line and stepped onto the smooth metal surface. It was exactly as the camera had shown—polished, seamless, slightly warm to the touch.

Hassan landed beside her. "My God. This is real."

The tunnel stretched in both directions, perfectly straight. The walls glowed faintly with their own light—not bright, just enough to see by.

After three billion years in darkness.

"The power source is still active," Alexis said. "Whatever this is, it's still functioning."

They moved deeper into the tunnel, instruments scanning constantly. No atmosphere beyond the trace amounts from surface seepage. Temperature stable at minus twenty Celsius. No radiation beyond background.

The tunnel led to the first cavity. The spherical chamber was exactly as Hassan's imaging had shown, but being inside it was different.

The walls were covered in patterns. Not random—deliberate. Mathematical sequences, geometric shapes, something that might have been writing in a language humans had never seen.

"We need to document everything," Hassan said, his voice hushed. "Every symbol, every measurement, every detail."

Alexis was already recording. Her helmet camera captured the chamber in high resolution while her suit sensors logged atmospheric data, temperature gradients, radiation levels.

The patterns seemed to shift in her peripheral vision. Probably just fatigue and adrenaline, but unsettling nonetheless.

"There's another tunnel," Hassan pointed to an opening opposite where they'd entered. "Leading to the second cavity."

They followed it. The second chamber was identical to the first, except for one detail.

In the center, on a raised platform, sat an object.

Roughly spherical, about the size of a basketball, made of the same material as the tunnel walls. Covered in more of the alien script.

Neither of them moved for a long moment.

"We should probably not touch that," Alexis said.

"Definitely not." Hassan circled the platform, recording from every angle. "But what is it?"

"Data storage? Power source? Religious artifact? A really old soccer ball?" Alexis checked her timer. "We've been down here fifty-five minutes. We should head back before Sofia calls in a rescue team."

Hassan took one last scan of the sphere. "This is going to change everything, Alexis. Not just Mars exploration. Everything. Proof that we're not alone. That intelligence existed elsewhere."

"Existed. Past tense." Alexis started back toward the shaft. "Whatever made this is long gone."

"Maybe. Or maybe they're just waiting."

Alexis didn't answer. The thought had occurred to her too, but saying it aloud felt like tempting fate.

They climbed back to the surface in silence. Sofia was waiting at the top, looking relieved and furious in equal measure.

"Two hours and three minutes. I was about to go get Rivera."

"We're fine." Alexis unsealed her helmet. "And Sofia? You're going to want to see this footage."

They transferred the data to the secure lab and watched it together. The tunnel. The chambers. The sphere.

Proof that humanity wasn't the first intelligence to reach Mars.

Just the first to come back.

"We report this tomorrow," Alexis said. "Rivera needs to know what we found."

Hassan nodded. "And then the world changes."

They sat in the quiet of the lab, surrounded by images of alien architecture, and tried to process what they'd discovered.

Somewhere deep beneath the Martian surface, secrets waited.

Secrets that had stayed hidden for three billion years.

Until now.
