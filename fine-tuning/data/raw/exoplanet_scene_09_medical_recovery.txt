Rafael Diaz floated in the medical bay, watching IV fluids pump antioxidants into his bloodstream. His hands still trembled slightly. The dopamine spike Dr. Chen warned about was wearing off, leaving him exhausted and irritable.

"How long until I feel normal?" he asked.

Dr. Chen checked the monitors. "Define normal. Your baseline neurotransmitter levels should stabilize in two weeks. The tremors will fade in three to four days. Cognitive function is already improving."

"I don't feel like it's improving."

"That's the serotonin depletion talking. You're coming down from a biochemically-induced high. It's going to be uncomfortable for a while."

Rafael pulled up his notes from the planet. Three weeks of survey work. Hundreds of samples collected. Discoveries that would reshape exobiology.

And the entire time, he'd been slowly poisoning himself.

"Did you know?" he asked. "When we were on the surface, did you suspect the atmospheric compounds were affecting us?"

"I suspected something was wrong when your reports started getting... enthusiastic. You were documenting findings at three times your normal rate. Making connections faster than typical analytical processing. That's not natural genius. That's altered brain chemistry."

Rafael felt embarrassed. He'd thought he was performing brilliantly. Instead, he'd been high on alien neurotoxins.

"What about the others?"

"Ling's fatigue was the opposite presentation—her system was shutting down instead of accelerating. Priya maintained better balance, probably because she spent more time in the sealed lab. Marcus showed early immune activation, which was probably protective."

"And if we'd stayed longer?"

Dr. Chen pulled up projections. "Rafael, you were maybe a week away from permanent damage. The dopamine levels you were experiencing? That's approaching psychosis territory. Another few days and you'd have lost ability to distinguish real patterns from imaginary ones."

Rafael felt cold despite the warm IV fluids. "I was seeing patterns everywhere. In the silicon structures, the Crystal Forest, the way the organisms distributed across the landscape. I thought I was making breakthrough connections."

"Some of them were probably real. Enhanced pattern recognition is a known effect of elevated dopamine. But it comes with a cost—inability to filter false positives. You start seeing meaning where there isn't any."

Rafael pulled up his field notes. Reading them now, some observations seemed brilliant. Others seemed... questionable. Had he really documented evidence of communication between silicon photosynthesizers? Or had he been seeing patterns that didn't exist?

"How do I know which observations are valid?"

"You don't. Not yet. We'll need to review all data once your neurochemistry stabilizes. Compare it against Ling and Priya's observations. See what holds up to collaborative scrutiny."

That was humbling. Three weeks of work, and he couldn't trust his own observations.

"This is what happens when humans encounter truly alien environments," Dr. Chen said. "We're not adapted for silicon-carbon biochemistry. Our bodies interpret those compounds as threats or opportunities depending on individual metabolism. You got the opportunity interpretation—enhanced cognition, increased energy, pattern recognition on overdrive. But it was unsustainable."

"And potentially delusional."

"Potentially. Which is why we have protocols for peer review and collaborative verification."

Rafael thought about the Crystal Forest. Had it really been as magnificent as he remembered? Or had the neurotoxins amplified his perceptions, making everything seem more significant, more beautiful, more meaningful?

"I want to go back," he said quietly.

Dr. Chen raised an eyebrow. "Back to the planet that was poisoning you?"

"With proper protection this time. Sealed environment suits, no atmospheric exposure, remote sampling equipment. Dr. Chen, there's so much we didn't understand. The dual biospheres, the silicon-based photosynthesis, the way the ecosystems coexist. We barely scratched the surface."

"Marcus recommended a research station. If Fleet approves it, you'll get your chance to go back."

"If they approve it. If they don't decide the planet's too dangerous and order it quarantined."

"Would that be wrong?" Dr. Chen asked. "If the environment is dangerous enough to cause neurological damage in three weeks, maybe it should be quarantined."

Rafael pulled up images of Kepler-442d. The rust-colored continents, the crystalline forests, the organisms that breathed through silicon semiconductors.

"It's dangerous because we're incompatible. Not because it's inherently hostile. The silicon photosynthesizers aren't trying to poison us. They're just existing in the way they evolved to exist."

"And we're trying to exist in an environment we didn't evolve for."

"Which is the challenge of all exoplanet exploration. We're never going to find a planet that's exactly like Earth. There will always be incompatibilities. The question is whether we learn to work around them or give up entirely."

Dr. Chen pulled up Rafael's latest blood work. "Your oxidative stress markers are dropping. That's good. But Rafael, you need to be realistic about what Kepler-442d offers. Even with protection, even with research stations, the biochemical incompatibility isn't going away."

"I know. But understanding it could help us colonize other worlds. If we can figure out how to neutralize silicon-carbon compounds, or engineer protection against them, we gain tools for dealing with other alien biochemistries."

"That's thinking long-term."

"Science is long-term thinking."

Dr. Chen smiled slightly. "Marcus said something similar. You're all infected with the same optimism."

"Is that the neurotoxins talking?"

"No. That's just who you are. You see a problem and immediately start thinking about solutions."

Rafael pulled up his survey data. Even accounting for potential dopamine-induced over-interpretation, the findings were significant. Silicon-based photosynthesis. Dual biospheres. Organisms that produced oxygen through mechanisms Earth had never evolved.

All of it real. All of it valuable. All of it dangerous to access.

"When can I start reviewing the data?"

"After your neurochemistry stabilizes. Probably two weeks. Until then, rest. Let your brain heal."

Rafael wanted to argue. Wanted to dive back into analysis immediately. But he could feel the exhaustion now. The crash from three weeks of biochemically-enhanced performance.

His body needed time to recover from what Kepler-442d had done to it.

"Dr. Chen, if Fleet approves the research station, I want to be on the first team back."

"Even knowing the risks?"

"Especially knowing the risks. We know what we're dealing with now. We can prepare better. Protect ourselves better."

"Or you could admit that some planets are too dangerous for human presence."

Rafael thought about that. About the Silicon photosynthesizers pulsing with bioluminescence. About the Crystal Forest glowing in alien sunlight. About discoveries that could reshape humanity's understanding of life's possibilities.

"Some planets are too dangerous for colonization," he said. "But no planet is too dangerous for science. Not if we're smart about how we approach it."

Dr. Chen made notes in his medical file. "I'm documenting that statement for the psychological evaluation. Fleet will want to know if your judgment was permanently affected by neurotoxin exposure."

"My judgment is fine. I'm not saying we should colonize Kepler-442d. I'm saying we should study it. There's a difference."

"A difference Fleet might not appreciate."

"Then Fleet needs to think bigger. We came out here to find new homes. Instead, we found proof that life can evolve in ways we never imagined. That's more valuable than any colony site."

Dr. Chen pulled up the colonist manifests. "Tell that to the eighteen thousand people waiting for news of a habitable planet."

Rafael felt the weight of that. Real people, with real hopes, depending on survey teams to find them a new world.

And he was recommending they leave this one alone.

"They'll find other planets. Better planets. Ones that don't poison them."

"You hope."

"I have to hope. Because the alternative is admitting that humanity might never find perfect compatibility out here. That every world we settle will require compromises, adaptations, risks."

"And if that's true?"

"Then we learn to manage the risks. We develop better protection. We understand alien biochemistries well enough to coexist with them. We become the species that can thrive anywhere, not just on Earth-clone worlds."

Dr. Chen was quiet for a moment. "The neurotoxins definitely enhanced your philosophical thinking."

Rafael laughed despite himself. "Or maybe nearly dying gives you perspective."

"Maybe. Either way, rest. You've got two weeks to recover before you can start working again."

After Dr. Chen left, Rafael floated in the medical bay, watching Kepler-442d through the viewport. The planet was smaller now, receding as the survey ship moved to the next target.

Beautiful. Dangerous. Incompatible.

Everything he'd dreamed of finding in alien worlds, wrapped in biochemistry that wanted him dead.

He pulled up the Crystal Forest images one more time. Even accounting for dopamine-induced enhancement, they were magnificent. Translucent trees spreading fractal branches against amber sky. Silicon semiconductors converting light to oxygen with elegant efficiency.

Evolution's masterpiece. In silicon instead of carbon. In semiconductor reactions instead of chlorophyll.

Proof that life was more creative than humanity's limited perspective suggested.

Rafael closed his eyes and felt the antioxidants working through his system. Cleaning up the damage. Restoring balance. Bringing him back from the edge of permanent neurological harm.

He'd been lucky. They'd all been lucky.

The next team would be more careful. Would use his data to prepare better. Would study Kepler-442d from behind proper protection.

And maybe, eventually, humanity would learn to coexist with silicon-based life.

Or maybe they'd just learn that some beauties were meant to be observed from a distance.

Either way, Rafael wanted to be part of that learning.

Even if it meant admitting his first encounter had nearly broken him.

Even if it meant accepting that wonder sometimes came with a price measured in neurotransmitter disruption and oxidative stress.

The universe didn't design planets for human convenience.

But it created wonders worth studying anyway.

Rafael drifted into medicated sleep, dreaming of crystalline forests glowing with impossible light.
