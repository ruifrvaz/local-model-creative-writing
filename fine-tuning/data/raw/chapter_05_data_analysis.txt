The data core hummed with quiet power. Dr. Aarav Patel sat cross-legged in front of the main terminal, three holographic displays floating around him like patient ghosts.

"You're going to love this," he said without looking up.

Elena stepped into the dimly lit space. The core was the ship's brain—every sensor reading, every transmission, every piece of data the Meridian had ever collected. If there were answers, they'd be here.

"Show me."

Patel gestured, and the displays rearranged themselves. "I ran a pattern analysis on the anomaly. Cross-referenced it with every known phenomenon in the database."

"And?"

"No matches. Not even close." He pulled up a spectral analysis. "But here's where it gets interesting. I went back through our sensor logs from the past six months. Found traces of similar readings—barely detectable, but there."

Elena leaned closer. The data painted a trail across the outer system. Small fluctuations in quantum foam density, localized gravity distortions. Nothing that would trigger alarms, but unmistakable once you knew what to look for.

"It's been following us," she said.

"Or we've been following it." Patel expanded the timeline. "The readings intensify near certain coordinates. Always in deep space, always far from major installations."

"Like it's avoiding detection."

"Or choosing its targets carefully." He brought up another screen. "I also found this."

The Phobos incident report filled the display. Classified. Elena's clearance barely scratched the surface.

"How did you—"

"Don't ask." Patel highlighted a section of the sensor logs from Phobos, taken hours before the station went dark. "Look at the quantum signature."

Elena felt her blood cool. The pattern was identical.

"Same source," Patel said. "Same anomaly. Whatever destroyed Phobos is out here with us."

"Why didn't anyone see this before?"

"They weren't looking. Or they were told not to." Patel closed the files. "Captain, this wasn't an accident. Something targeted Phobos. And now it's targeting us."

Elena straightened. Her cybernetic arm whirred softly—a nervous tic she'd developed. "What else have you found?"

"Bits and pieces. Encrypted transmissions in the background noise. Energy signatures that don't match any known technology." He met her eyes. "Whatever this is, it's not natural. And it's not human."

The core's hum seemed louder in the silence.

"Keep digging," Elena said. "And Patel? This stays between us until we know more."

"Understood." He turned back to his screens. "Captain? Be careful. If someone buried the Phobos connection, they had a reason."

Elena left him there, surrounded by ghosts made of light and data.

In the corridor, she paused to think. Patel's findings changed everything. If the anomaly had targeted Phobos deliberately, that suggested intelligence. Purpose. And if Fleet knew about the connection and didn't warn them, that suggested something even worse: politics.

She activated her neural link and sent a coded message to Marcus. They needed to talk privately.

While she waited for his response, Elena pulled up Katie's personal logs on her wrist display. Her sister's voice filled her earpiece, recorded three days before the Phobos incident.

"Day forty-seven of the anomaly study. The energy patterns are becoming more complex. Almost like it's responding to our presence. The AI thinks we're seeing structured data—intentional signals rather than natural phenomena. I've requested permission to attempt direct communication through the neural interface. Waiting on approval from Fleet Command."

The log ended. Katie had never gotten that approval. But she'd attempted the interface anyway—that was the kind of person she was. Rules were suggestions when science beckoned.

And it had killed her.

Elena closed the file and opened the next one. Katie's voice, now tinged with excitement.

"The mathematics are beautiful, Elena. If you could see what I'm seeing—dimensions folding into themselves, time running in non-linear patterns. It's like the universe is showing me its source code. I think I can decode it. I think I can talk to it."

Another log, this one marked eighteen hours before the cascade.

"I made contact. Brief, but unmistakable. The anomaly responded to a prime number sequence. It sent back a mathematical proof I've never seen before—elegant, perfect, proving a theorem humanity hasn't discovered yet. This is it, sis. This is first contact. I'm documenting everything. If I'm right, we're not alone. We never were."

The final log was corrupted. Partial audio, broken by static and what sounded like screaming. Elena had listened to it a hundred times, trying to extract meaning from the chaos. All she could make out was Katie's voice saying three words: "It's too much."

Then nothing.

Elena closed the files and leaned against the bulkhead. Her sister had been right—she'd made contact. But the price had been everything.

Marcus appeared around the corner, his expression guarded. "Your message said it was urgent."

"Patel found the connection. Phobos and our anomaly—same source."

Marcus absorbed that. "Fleet knows?"

"Either they know and didn't tell us, or they should've known and didn't look." Elena pulled him into an empty lab. "Either way, we're proceeding under the assumption that official channels are compromised."

"You think this is a cover-up?"

"I think three hundred people died, Fleet classified everything above top secret, and then sent us out here with orders to make contact with something they claim they don't understand." Elena met his eyes. "That's either incompetence or conspiracy, and I'm not sure which is worse."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. "What do you want to do?"

"Our job. We make contact, we document everything, and we make damn sure the truth gets out this time." Elena's cybernetic hand clenched. "Katie died trying to understand this thing. I'm not going to let Fleet bury what she discovered."

"Even if it costs us our careers?"

"Even if it costs us more than that."

Marcus nodded slowly. "Then I'm with you. What's the play?"

"We continue the mission. But we keep our own records—encrypted, off the ship's main systems. If something happens to us, I want the data to survive."

"I'll set it up. What about the crew?"

"They need to know what we're really doing. No more classified bullshit. Full transparency." Elena headed for the door. "Schedule a senior staff meeting. It's time we had an honest conversation about Project Threshold."

As she left, Elena glanced back at the data core. Patel was still there, diving deeper into the patterns, chasing the truth through layers of encrypted data and classified files.

Katie had done the same thing. And it had killed her.

But some truths were worth dying for.

Elena just hoped they wouldn't have to.
