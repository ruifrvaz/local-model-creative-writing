The data core hummed with quiet power. Dr. Aarav Patel sat cross-legged in front of the main terminal, three holographic displays floating around him like patient ghosts.

"You're going to love this," he said without looking up.

Elena stepped into the dimly lit space. The core was the ship's brain—every sensor reading, every transmission, every piece of data the Meridian had ever collected. If there were answers, they'd be here.

"Show me."

Patel gestured, and the displays rearranged themselves. "I ran a pattern analysis on the anomaly. Cross-referenced it with every known phenomenon in the database."

"And?"

"No matches. Not even close." He pulled up a spectral analysis. "But here's where it gets interesting. I went back through our sensor logs from the past six months. Found traces of similar readings—barely detectable, but there."

Elena leaned closer. The data painted a trail across the outer system. Small fluctuations in quantum foam density, localized gravity distortions. Nothing that would trigger alarms, but unmistakable once you knew what to look for.

"It's been following us," she said.

"Or we've been following it." Patel expanded the timeline. "The readings intensify near certain coordinates. Always in deep space, always far from major installations."

"Like it's avoiding detection."

"Or choosing its targets carefully." He brought up another screen. "I also found this."

The Phobos incident report filled the display. Classified. Elena's clearance barely scratched the surface.

"How did you—"

"Don't ask." Patel highlighted a section of the sensor logs from Phobos, taken hours before the station went dark. "Look at the quantum signature."

Elena felt her blood cool. The pattern was identical.

"Same source," Patel said. "Same anomaly. Whatever destroyed Phobos is out here with us."

"Why didn't anyone see this before?"

"They weren't looking. Or they were told not to." Patel closed the files. "Captain, this wasn't an accident. Something targeted Phobos. And now it's targeting us."

Elena straightened. Her cybernetic arm whirred softly—a nervous tic she'd developed. "What else have you found?"

"Bits and pieces. Encrypted transmissions in the background noise. Energy signatures that don't match any known technology." He met her eyes. "Whatever this is, it's not natural. And it's not human."

The core's hum seemed louder in the silence.

"Keep digging," Elena said. "And Patel? This stays between us until we know more."

"Understood." He turned back to his screens. "Captain? Be careful. If someone buried the Phobos connection, they had a reason."

Elena left him there, surrounded by ghosts made of light and data. In the corridor, she activated her neural link and sent a coded message to Marcus.

They needed to talk. Privately.
