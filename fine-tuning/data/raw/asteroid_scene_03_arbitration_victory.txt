Captain Jax Torres stood in the independent station's arbitration chamber, facing three corporate lawyers and a very expensive arbitrator.

"Mr. Torres, you claim ownership of mineral samples extracted from asteroid KB-774," the arbitrator began. "Corporate claims the asteroid falls within their exploration charter."

"Their charter expired two years ago," Jax replied. "KB-774 is unclaimed territory. My crew extracted these samples legally."

"Legality is debatable when the samples represent unprecedented scientific value," Corporate's lead lawyer interjected. "Such discoveries fall under planetary protection protocols."

"Those protocols apply to inhabited worlds. KB-774 is a rock." Jax pulled up the legal precedents. "Independent prospecting rights are clear. We found it, we extracted it, we own it."

The arbitration continued for six hours. Legal arguments, precedent citations, jurisdictional disputes. Corporate tried every angle to claim the samples.

Jax countered each one, backed by data from Dr. Sofia Ruiz and legal research from Freeport Station's independent advocates.

Finally, the arbitrator called for recess. "I'll review the arguments and issue a ruling within seventy-two hours."

Jax returned to his ship, exhausted. Wrench met him in the galley with coffee and a grim expression.

"Corporate ship docked at the station two hours ago," Wrench reported. "They're not waiting for the ruling."

"They can't touch us here. Freeport is neutral territory."

"Since when does corporate respect neutrality?" Wrench pulled up the station feeds. "They're setting up security at the docking bays. Not illegal, but intimidating."

Kayla appeared from the cockpit. "I'm picking up encrypted communications between corporate ship and Earth. They're planning something."

"Can you decrypt?"

"Working on it. But Jax, they're not going to let us leave with those samples. Legal ruling or not."

Jax pulled up the station layout. "Then we need insurance. Sofia, how are the samples secured?"

Dr. Ruiz emerged from her lab, looking tired. "Triple-sealed containers, station vault, biometric access. Corporate can't get to them without starting a war."

"They might anyway." Jax activated his comm. "Station security, this is Captain Torres. I need to report a potential security threat."

The station's security director arrived within minutes. Hard-eyed woman named Kowalski, ex-military, fiercely protective of Freeport's independence.

"Corporate giving you trouble?" she asked.

"They will be. Once that arbitration ruling comes down." Jax showed her the corporate ship positioning. "They're preparing to take our samples by force."

Kowalski studied the data. "On my station? I don't think so." She activated station-wide security protocols. "Corporate doesn't own Freeport. And they don't intimidate independents under my watch."

The next forty-eight hours were tense. Corporate security maintaining visible presence. Jax's crew staying alert. Kowalski's station security monitoring everything.

When the ruling came down, Jax had won. Full rights to the samples. Corporate had no legal claim.

The corporate ship requested immediate departure clearance. Kowalski granted it—she didn't want trouble on her station.

But as the corporate vessel undocked, Jax's sensors detected something wrong.

"They planted a tracker," Kayla reported. "Attached to our hull during the arbitration. They're going to follow us when we leave."

"Can you remove it?"

"If I do an EVA, yes. But that means staying docked longer."

Jax calculated. Corporate wanted to follow them to wherever they planned to sell the samples. Then steal or sabotage or apply pressure away from neutral territory.

"We don't remove it," Jax decided. "We use it."

"Explain," Sofia said.

"We let them think they're tracking us. We leave with the samples, head toward a destination. Then we transfer the samples to another ship and double back."

"What other ship?" Wrench asked.

Jax pulled up the independent traders registry. "Plenty of independent haulers operating through Freeport. We pay one to carry our samples to market. Corporate tracks us while the real cargo goes elsewhere."

Kayla grinned. "Misdirection. I like it."

They arranged the transfer carefully. An independent hauler named Prairie Wind, heading to Earth's orbital stations. Captain Lee was willing to carry secured cargo, no questions asked, for a reasonable fee.

The sample transfer happened in a sealed cargo bay. No external surveillance. The Prairie Wind loaded the containers and departed on their scheduled route.

Jax's crew waited twelve hours, then requested departure clearance with empty cargo holds.

"Departing for asteroid belt survey operations," Jax reported to station control.

They left Freeport, the corporate tracker transmitting their position faithfully.

The corporate ship followed at discrete distance.

Jax led them on a merry chase through the asteroid belt. Random trajectories, survey patterns, prospecting maneuvers. Keeping them occupied while Prairie Wind carried the samples to Earth.

Three weeks later, Prairie Wind docked at Earth Station One. The samples were delivered to the International Scientific Authority. Public cataloging. Open research access. Impossible to suppress or claim.

Corporate realized they'd been tracking an empty ship.

By then, it was too late.

Jax received a message from Captain Lee: "Samples delivered. Payment confirmed. Pleasure doing business. —Lee"

He gathered his crew in the galley. "We did it. Samples are public. Discovery is protected. Corporate lost."

"They're going to be pissed," Wrench observed.

"Let them be pissed from forty million kilometers away." Jax pulled up the news feeds. The samples were already generating scientific interest. Research proposals. Grant applications. Academic papers.

The discovery belonged to everyone now.

"So what's next?" Sofia asked. "We go back to standard prospecting?"

"We go back to being independent miners," Jax confirmed. "Find rocks, extract minerals, sell what we find. The normal routine."

"After making the discovery of the century and defeating corporate legal teams?"

"After proving that independents can compete with corporate power. That knowledge matters more than ownership. That some things are worth fighting for." Jax raised his coffee. "To independence. To discovery. To beating the system."

They toasted. Small victories. Big principles.

Life on the margins of corporate space.

It wasn't easy. It wasn't safe.

But it was free.

And for independent miners, freedom was worth everything.
