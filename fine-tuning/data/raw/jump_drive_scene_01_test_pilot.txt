Lieutenant Chen stepped into the jump chamber for the third time that week. Her hands were steady despite the nausea that never quite left anymore.

"Vitals look good," Dr. Mbara said, attaching monitoring leads. "Heart rate elevated but within acceptable parameters."

"It's always elevated before a jump." Chen settled into the pilot's seat. The chamber was small, claustrophobic, lined with instrumentation that tracked every biological process during transit. "I keep expecting it to get easier."

"It won't. The human body wasn't designed for faster-than-light travel." Mbara checked the neural monitoring array. "You're experiencing temporal distortion at the cellular level. Your brain knows something's wrong even if you can't articulate it."

Chen pulled on her interface glove. The neural connection synced with a familiar pins-and-needles sensation. Through the glove, she could feel the jump drive's quantum state—a sensation like touching ice and fire simultaneously.

"Drive status?" she asked.

"Stable. Admiral Kowalski wants a clean jump—ten light-years, zero drift, minimal biological stress." Mbara didn't look optimistic. "We've never achieved all three simultaneously."

"First time for everything."

Dr. Yamamoto's voice came through the comm from the observation deck. "Lieutenant Chen, we've modified the Alcubierre field geometry based on last week's data. Should reduce the temporal shear by eighteen percent."

"Should?"

"The mathematics are sound. But we're extrapolating from incomplete data."

Chen smiled. "Story of this project."

She initiated the pre-jump sequence. The drive powered up with a sound like reality tearing—a deep bass note that resonated in her bones. The quantum containment field stabilized at ninety-seven percent.

Good enough.

"Jump in thirty seconds," Chen announced.

The countdown felt eternal and instantaneous. Chen watched the numbers tick down, her enhanced perception fragmenting time into strange intervals.

Ten seconds. Her vision started to double.

Five seconds. The temporal distortion began, the universe fracturing into might-be states.

Zero.

The jump hit like a physical blow. Chen felt herself stretched across ten light-years, every atom of her body existing in superposition between here and there. Time stopped having meaning. Past and future collapsed into a singular nightmare present where she was everywhere and nowhere.

Then reality snapped back.

Chen gasped, her body shaking. The monitors screamed—elevated heart rate, cortisol spike, neural patterns showing extreme stress.

"Jump complete," she managed. "Navigation, confirm position."

"Confirming." Pause. "We overshot by point-seven light-years."

Chen closed her eyes. Still drifting. Still imperfect. "Biological status?"

Dr. Mbara was already running scans. "Your cellular age increased by forty-eight hours. Telomere degradation consistent with moderate aging stress."

"So I lost two days of my life for a ten-light-year jump with drift."

"The drift is improving. Last jump was one point three light-years off target."

Small comfort. Chen disconnected from the drive interface and immediately vomited into the waste receptacle. Jump sickness—another gift of FTL travel.

Mbara helped her to the medical bay. The anti-nausea medication helped, but the temporal distortion took hours to fully resolve. Chen lay on the examination table while her cells slowly remembered which timeline they belonged to.

Admiral Kowalski appeared in the doorway. "Status?"

"Alive. Aged. Nauseated." Chen sat up slowly. "Navigation drift is decreasing but still unacceptable for military deployment."

"The mathematics don't account for human factors," Yamamoto said, joining them. "The drive creates perfect spacetime geometry. But the pilot's neural interface introduces uncertainty. Your consciousness exists outside normal causality during the jump. That creates drift."

"So the better pilot I am, the worse the drift?"

"Possibly. We're still analyzing the data." Yamamoto pulled up Chen's biological readings. "Your cellular aging is concerning. At this rate, twenty jumps would age you by months."

"Then we limit jump frequency. Standard protocol, minimum seventy-two hours between jumps." Kowalski studied the data. "Lieutenant Chen, I need your honest assessment. Is this viable for human pilots?"

Chen considered. She'd made thirty-seven jumps in six months. Each one harder than the last. Her body was breaking down—telomere degradation, cumulative cellular stress, psychological strain from experiencing temporal non-existence.

But they'd achieved faster-than-light travel. They'd broken causality and survived.

"It's viable," she said. "But it's not sustainable. Not for long-term operations. The biological cost is too high."

"Then we find a way to reduce the cost." Kowalski turned to Yamamoto. "What about AI pilots? Remove the human consciousness variable entirely."

"AI can't navigate jump space. The quantum uncertainty requires conscious observation to collapse the probability functions. Without a human mind in the loop, the drive won't engage."

"So we're stuck with biological limitations."

"We're stuck with biology period," Mbara interjected. "FTL travel isn't just physics. It's neurology, cell biology, psychology. The Lieutenant isn't operating machinery. She's becoming part of the spacetime manifold."

Silence. Chen had never heard it articulated quite that way, but it felt accurate. During jumps, she didn't pilot the drive. She became the drive. Her consciousness expanding across light-years, her perception fragmenting into quantum probability states.

"I'll make it work," Chen said. "Whatever modifications we need. I'm the best pilot you have."

"You're the only pilot who hasn't quit or suffered complete psychological breakdown," Kowalski corrected. "That's not the same thing."

"Then I'm exactly what you need."

Kowalski studied her. "Seventy-two hours minimum between jumps. Full medical clearance required. The moment Dr. Mbara says you're done, you're grounded. Clear?"

"Clear."

They left Chen in the medical bay. Mbara ran additional scans while Chen stared at the ceiling, feeling her cells slowly stabilize.

"You don't have to prove anything," Mbara said quietly. "The jumps are killing you. Slowly, but measurably."

"I know."

"And you'll keep doing it anyway."

"Someone has to." Chen met Mbara's eyes. "We're on the edge of something extraordinary. Faster-than-light travel was impossible yesterday. Today I can cross ten light-years in the time it takes to blink. That's worth the cost."

"Is it worth dying for?"

Chen had asked herself that question after every jump. The answer never changed.

"Yes."

Mbara didn't argue. She'd heard the conviction in Chen's voice. The same conviction that drove every test pilot, every pioneer who pushed boundaries knowing the cost.

Seventy-two hours later, Chen was back in the jump chamber.

Different destination. Same temporal nightmare. Same physical toll.

But the drift improved. Point-four light-years this time.

Progress.

The cellular aging was cumulative. The nausea was becoming chronic. Chen's neural patterns showed stress damage that might be permanent.

But the drift kept decreasing.

Jump forty-two showed drift of only point-one light-years.

Jump fifty-three achieved zero drift. Perfect navigation across fifteen light-years. Chen aged seventy-eight hours and spent two days in medical recovery, but the jump was flawless.

Kowalski filed the report with Fleet Command. Proof of concept. Viable faster-than-light navigation with human pilot interface.

The cost in pilot health went unmentioned.

Chen didn't care. She'd proven it was possible.

Now she had to prove it was survivable.

Yamamoto developed modified jump protocols—reduced field strength, stepped acceleration, neural feedback dampening. The jumps became gentler. The biological cost decreased.

Chen aged four days across ten jumps instead of twenty.

Still unsustainable. Still killing her.

But slower.

And time was what they needed. Time to develop better shielding, better medical protocols, better understanding of how human consciousness interacted with spacetime manipulation.

Chen volunteered for every test. Pushed every boundary. Accepted every cost.

Because someone had to prove humanity belonged among the stars.

Even if it killed them.

The mathematics were sound.

The biology would catch up eventually.

She hoped.
