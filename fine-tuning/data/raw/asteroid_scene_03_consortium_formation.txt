Kayla Okonkwo sat in the pilot's chair and watched the stars. Not through the viewport—those were shuttered for radiation protection. But on the nav screen, where each point of light represented a potential escape vector.

Or a place to die.

The Salvage Rights drifted at the consortium meeting coordinates. Three days of constant burn to get here, depleting their fuel reserves to dangerous levels. Now they waited while other independent ships converged on the location.

If this was a trap, they were dead. No fuel to run. No weapons to fight.

Kayla pulled up the family photos on her personal tablet. Her mother in Lagos. Her brother in the Mars colonies. Her niece, just turned three, who called Kayla "Auntie Space" because she didn't understand orbital mechanics yet.

All of them depending on the money Kayla sent home every month. Money that would stop if the Salvage Rights disappeared into the black.

"Picking up transponder signals," she said. "Four ships inbound."

Jax appeared behind her. "Friendlies?"

"Keiko's ship plus three unknowns. Could be consortium members. Could be pirates using consortium transponders."

"Optimistic as always."

"Realistic." Kayla pulled up the intercept calculations. "If they're hostile, we have maybe ninety seconds before weapons range."

"And if they're friendly?"

"Then we just burned three days of fuel getting paranoid."

The ships closed to visual range. Kayla recognized Keiko's vessel—the modified freight hauler with oversized engines. The other three were mining ships like theirs. Battered. Patched. Running on hope and spite.

Fellow independents.

"They're hailing," Kayla said.

Jax activated the comm. Keiko's face appeared on screen, flanked by three other captains. Hard faces. Belt miners who'd survived corporate pressure and the vacuum's indifference.

"Captain Torres," Keiko said. "Welcome to the consortium. These are Captains Mbeki, Ivanova, and Chen. We've all found deposits similar to yours."

The other captains nodded. Mbeki spoke first—deep voice with an Earth accent. "We're here because corporate tried to claim jump our sites. Tried to buy us out cheap or threaten us into silence. Keiko says you got the same treatment."

"Threatening comm within an hour of discovery," Jax confirmed.

"That's their pattern," Ivanova said. She had a scar across her face that suggested she'd faced more than corporate lawyers. "They monitor survey patterns. The moment you hit something valuable, they move in."

"Question is what we do about it," Captain Chen said. No relation to their Chen—just unfortunate coincidence. "Six ships against the entire corporate mining apparatus. We're outgunned."

"Not if we go public," Keiko said. "We file simultaneous claims. Release the survey data. Make this discovery too big to bury."

"Corporate will challenge the claims in court," Mbeki said.

"Let them. We'll have public attention by then. Media coverage. Scientific interest. They can't make us disappear once everyone's watching."

"They can make our lives very difficult," Ivanova said.

"They're already doing that." Keiko pulled up a shared data screen. "Here's what we've found collectively. Six deposits of this energy-dense material across the belt. All exhibiting similar properties. If Sofia's analysis is correct, this could revolutionize power generation."

Kayla watched Jax's expression. He was calculating. Weighing options. Trying to find the path that kept his crew alive and solvent.

"What's the plan?" he asked.

"We pool our resources. Hire legal representation through the coalition. File claims through proper channels but make it a media event. Show humanity that independents can make discoveries that matter."

"And when corporate retaliates?"

"We defend together. Six ships is a fleet. We can't match corporate firepower, but we can make them think twice about escalation."

Captain Chen pulled up a tactical display. "We establish a defensive perimeter around the largest deposit—mine. Use it as our stronghold. If corporate comes for one, they face all of us."

"That means abandoning our individual claims," Mbeki said.

"Temporarily. We work the main deposit as a consortium. Split profits equally. Once we've established legal precedent and security, we can branch out to our individual sites."

Kayla did the math. Equal split six ways was still better than losing everything. And corporate would have to go through six crews instead of picking them off individually.

"I'm in," Ivanova said. "Lost my last ship to corporate games. Not losing this one."

"Agreed," Mbeki said.

Captain Chen nodded.

Jax looked at Kayla. She knew what he was asking. Risk assessment. Is this worth it?

Kayla thought about her niece. About her mother working double shifts in Lagos so Kayla could afford academy training. About every independent miner who'd been crushed under corporate boots.

"Do it," she said.

Jax activated his comm. "Captain Torres of the Salvage Rights. We're consortium."

Keiko smiled. "Then let's make history. Transmit your full survey data. We're filing claims in three hours. Simultaneous announcement to every media outlet in the system."

The six ships moved into formation. Not military precision—they were miners, not soldiers. But there was something powerful in seeing them together. A statement that independents could stand against giants.

Kayla plotted the course to Captain Chen's deposit. Two days burn. They could manage that with remaining fuel if they ran the reactors hot.

Sofia appeared on the bridge. "We're really doing this? Going up against corporate?"

"We're claiming what's ours," Jax said. "And making sure they can't bury it."

"They're going to fight back."

"Probably. But Kayla's a hell of a pilot. Chen builds defensive systems out of scrap. You're brilliant at geology. And I'm too stubborn to quit." Jax pulled up the consortium charter. "We've got a chance. Maybe not a good one, but better than we had yesterday."

Kayla initiated the burn sequence. The Salvage Rights' engines fired, pushing them toward the consortium stronghold. Around them, five other ships did the same.

Six lights in the darkness. Moving together.

Kayla pulled up the comm to her mother. Encrypted personal channel.

"Mama, I'm doing something that might make the news. Might make us some money. Might get me killed. But it's the right thing. Tell everyone I love them."

She sent it and hoped she'd live long enough to send another.

The engines hummed. The stars wheeled past. And somewhere ahead, corporate interests were probably just learning that six independent miners had decided to stand together.

This was going to get messy.

But Kayla had flown through worse.

She hoped.
