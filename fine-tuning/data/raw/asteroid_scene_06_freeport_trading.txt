Kayla Okonkwo brought the Lucky Strike into docking position with precision that made the maneuver look easy. It wasn't. The independent station Freeport Three rotated with wobble from asymmetric construction, docking ports at odd angles, approach vectors that required constant adjustment.

"Docking complete," she announced. "Welcome to civilization. Such as it is."

Captain Jax unbuckled from the command seat. "How long can we stay before fuel costs eat our profits?"

"Seventy-two hours. After that, we're burning money on station fees."

Freeport Three was one of dozens of independent stations scattered through the Belt. No corporate ownership, no government control. Just a collection of miners, traders, engineers, and assorted Belt rats who preferred autonomy to security.

The station interior was chaos. Pressurized corridors carved from hollowed asteroids, hab modules jury-rigged together, market stalls selling everything from replacement parts to questionable pharmaceuticals.

Jax found the trader he needed in the lower market. Marcus Osei, fence for anything too hot or too interesting for legitimate channels.

"Captain Torres. Heard you pulled off a nice rescue last month. Building reputation."

"Word travels."

"Always does. What are you selling?"

Jax pulled up the manifest. Nickel-iron ore from their legitimate mining operations. Nothing exotic, nothing that would raise questions.

Osei scanned it. "Standard rates. Thirty-five thousand credits. Unless you've got something more interesting."

"Like what?"

"Like whatever you're really here to discuss. Don't waste my time with ore manifest. You came to Freeport for something else."

Jax had been planning this conversation for weeks. Osei was discreet but not stupid. Any hint of exotic matter would spread through the independent network within hours.

"Hypothetically, if someone had advanced materials. Things not on standard markets. How would they go about selling quietly?"

"Hypothetically, they wouldn't. Advanced materials attract attention. Corporate attention. Government attention. The kind that gets people disappeared."

"So there's no market?"

"Didn't say that. Said it's dangerous. But if theoretical person had theoretical valuable materials, I'd suggest small sales to trusted buyers. Never enough to trigger pattern recognition. Never the same buyer twice."

"And you know such buyers?"

"I might. For appropriate finder's fee and absolute discretion."

Jax considered. Selling exotic matter through channels like this meant accepting lower prices and higher risk. But it avoided corporate scrutiny.

"Set up a meeting. Someone trustworthy."

"Trustworthy is expensive."

"I'm aware."

Osei pulled up a contact list on his encrypted terminal. "There's a researcher at Luna Station. Dr. Amara Chen. Reputable, discreet, has funding sources that don't ask questions. She'd pay fair price for interesting materials."

"How fair?"

"Depends on materials. But better than you'd get trying to sell openly."

"Arrange it."

While Jax negotiated, Wrench was in Freeport's engineering district, trading technical knowledge for parts they couldn't afford otherwise.

"I need high-capacity power regulators," he told the parts dealer. "Rated for exotic matter processing."

The dealer's expression didn't change. "Don't carry exotic matter equipment. Too specialized."

"I'm not asking you to carry it. I'm asking you to know someone who does."

"That kind of information costs."

Wrench pulled out a data chip. "I've got complete schematics for improved fusion torch efficiency modifications. Increases thrust by twelve percent with same fuel consumption."

The dealer plugged in the chip, scanned the contents. "This is good work. Worth something."

"Worth a name?"

"Worth a name." The dealer wrote down coordinates. "Station Forty-Seven, spinward sector. Ask for Chen. Tell him Rodriguez sent you. He'll have what you need."

Sofia was having her own conversations in the station's science district. Trading exotic matter analysis data for equipment access and lab time.

"I need high-resolution spectroscopy," she told the station's research coordinator. "Three hours, secured lab, no records."

"That's unusual request. What are you analyzing?"

"Materials that don't officially exist."

"Ah. One of those. Standard rate is five thousand credits per hour."

"I can pay in data instead. Analysis techniques for detecting exotic signatures in asteroid formations."

The coordinator's interest sharpened. "That's valuable information."

"Worth three hours of lab time?"

"Worth six. You share your techniques, I'll give you full access and help with analysis."

They traded knowledge like currency. Sofia's expertise for lab time and equipment. Both parties benefiting from cooperation rather than hoarding resources.

That was how the independent network survived. Sharing, trading, building capabilities through collective knowledge rather than corporate hierarchies.

Kayla spent her time in the pilot's quarter, gathering intelligence on corporate activities.

"Helios is pushing hard into the outer Belt," one pilot told her. "New survey operations, increased legal challenges to independent claims. They're squeezing."

"Anyone pushing back?"

"A few. Independent Miners' Collective tried organizing strike. Helios just hired scabs and waited them out."

"So organized resistance doesn't work."

"Not when corporations control the markets. They can outlast us financially."

Kayla filed that information away. The Lucky Strike's exotic matter was valuable precisely because it could reduce dependence on corporate supply chains. But only if they used it smartly.

After three days on Freeport, they'd accomplished more than a month of normal operations could have. Parts acquired, knowledge traded, contacts made, exotic matter sample sold to Dr. Chen for enough credits to fund another three months of operations.

As they prepared to depart, Jax pulled his crew together.

"We did good here. Built relationships, moved materials, stayed under corporate radar. This is how we survive long-term. Not through big scores but through steady network building."

"And the exotic matter?" Wrench asked.

"We use it strategically. Power our own operations, reduce dependence, build capability. Don't sell it all for quick money. Save it for things that change our fundamentals."

Sofia pulled up her analysis results from the borrowed lab time. "I've figured out how to synthesize one of the alien artifact materials. Not at scale, but enough for testing. Could revolutionize energy storage if we develop it properly."

"How long?"

"Years. But we can start small. Build prototypes. Test applications."

Jax looked at Freeport Three through the viewport. Ramshackle station held together by ingenuity and cooperation. Home to thousands of Belt rats who'd chosen freedom over corporate employment.

This was their community. Their network. Their future.

The Lucky Strike undocked carefully, maneuvering through Freeport's chaotic traffic patterns. Kayla handled it with practiced ease.

"Next stop?" she asked.

"Back to the Belt. We've got mining contracts to fulfill and exotic matter to extract properly. Plus that alien artifact to study when we have time."

"Busy schedule."

"Better than boring. And better than working for consortiums."

They burned away from Freeport, back toward the asteroid fields where fortunes were made and lost daily.

The Lucky Strike was still an aging ship held together by improvisation. Still operating on thin margins and thinner luck.

But they had network now. Contacts. Knowledge flowing between independents who understood that cooperation beat competition when you were fighting corporations with infinite resources.

That was worth more than any single score.

Worth the risk, the struggle, the constant uncertainty.

Because freedom had value beyond credits.

And community had strength corporations couldn't buy.

They'd figure out the rest as they went.

Same as always.

One trade at a time.

One relationship at a time.

One small victory against the grinding machinery of corporate control.

It wasn't much.

But it was theirs.

And in the Belt, that was everything.
