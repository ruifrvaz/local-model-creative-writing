Lieutenant Sarah Chen sat in the medical bay while sensors mapped her neural activity. Dr. Aisha Mbara watched the displays with the expression she reserved for data that refused to make sense.

"Your brain is healthy. Neurologically, you're perfectly normal."

"Then why does time feel broken?"

Aisha pulled up the temporal perception tests. "Your circadian rhythm is desynchronized by forty-seven minutes. Your short-term time estimation is off by an average of thirty-two percent. And your memory consolidation shows gaps that suggest missing time."

Sarah closed her eyes. She remembered entering the jump field. Remembered the sensation of reality stretching like taffy. Then—nothing. A blank spot where three seconds should have been. Then emergence, and the world moving too fast or too slow depending on which part of her brain was processing input.

"Is it permanent?"

"I don't know. We've never had test subjects experience FTL travel before." Aisha highlighted neural patterns. "Your hippocampus—the part that processes temporal sequencing—is showing unusual activity. Like it's trying to reconcile conflicting timelines."

"Because I lived through them."

"Or because your neurons experienced the jump at different rates." Aisha pulled up Kenji's latest calculations. "Dr. Yamamoto thinks the bubble collapse creates microseconds of temporal variance across the ship. Your neural tissue at the front of your skull might have experienced those microseconds differently than tissue at the back."

Sarah absorbed that. Her brain had traveled through time at different speeds. Parts of her had arrived before other parts.

"That should have killed me."

"It should have done a lot of things. Mostly, it shouldn't have been possible." Aisha ran another scan. "But here you are. Alive, functional, just slightly unstuck in time."

"Can it be fixed?"

"Can you fix causality? This isn't a medical problem, Lieutenant. It's a physics problem. Your body is fine. It's just existing in slightly different timeframes simultaneously."

Sarah looked at her hands. They appeared normal. Moved normally. But sometimes—when she wasn't paying attention—they'd blur. Not visually. Temporally. Like they were occupying multiple moments at once.

"How many more jumps before this gets worse?"

Aisha's silence was answer enough.

"Dr. Yamamoto suspended the test program," Sarah said. "Admiral Kowalski overruled him."

"When?"

"Two hours ago. I'm scheduled for jump five tomorrow."

Aisha stood abruptly. "That's insane. We don't understand the temporal effects. You could experience catastrophic neural desync."

"The admiral considers that an acceptable risk. The program needs data. I'm the only pilot qualified for FTL transition."

"You're the only pilot willing to risk your brain for a military deadline."

Sarah met her eyes. "I knew the risks when I volunteered. Every test pilot in history knew the risks."

"They knew about mechanical failure. G-forces. Decompression. Not temporal paradoxes." Aisha pulled up medical protocols. "I can ground you. Declare you unfit for jump operations until we understand the neural effects."

"And they'll find another pilot. Someone less experienced. Someone who'll die because I wasn't brave enough to continue."

"Bravery isn't the same as suicide."

"Neither is duty." Sarah stood. The room swam for a moment—her inner ear saying she'd stood three seconds ago while her eyes insisted it was just now. She steadied herself against the examination table. "Run the pre-jump physical. Clear me for duty."

"Sarah—"

"That's an order, Doctor."

Aisha's jaw tightened. Military hierarchy versus medical ethics. The eternal conflict.

"I'll clear you. But I'm also filing a formal objection with Admiral Kowalski. And I'm monitoring your neural activity continuously during jump five. Any sign of catastrophic desync, I'm pulling you out."

"Fair enough."

The physical took an hour. Blood work normal. Cardiovascular normal. Reflexes normal. Everything normal except the fundamental human experience of time passing in a linear, predictable way.

Sarah left the medical bay and headed for her quarters. The corridor stretched ahead. Twenty meters. Thirty steps. Except she'd taken thirty steps and was only halfway there. Her brain and body disagreeing about distance, time, causality.

She reached her door eventually. Inside, personal items arranged with military precision. Photos of family back on Earth. Her Academy graduation certificate. A small collection of books—actual paper books, because reading on screens made the time distortion worse.

Sarah pulled up her personal logs and started recording.

"Jump four plus eighteen hours. Time perception still erratic. Experienced three separate instances of temporal blur—moments where I occupied two different times simultaneously. Duration: microseconds, but subjectively noticeable. Dr. Mbara confirms neural desynchronization is ongoing."

She paused. Her reflection in the dark viewport showed a face that looked older than twenty-eight. Or younger. Depended on when she was looking.

"Jump five scheduled for tomorrow. Dr. Yamamoto objects. Dr. Mbara objects. I object, if I'm honest. But the mission requires data. And someone has to be first."

First through the temporal barrier. First to experience time as a flexible, negotiable thing. First to discover whether human consciousness could survive fragmentation across multiple timestreams.

First to die, potentially.

"If this goes wrong—if jump five creates permanent desync—I want it on record that I volunteered. Nobody forced me. I understood the risks."

Did she, though? Could anyone understand risks that violated causality itself?

Sarah thought about her family. Her mother, who'd protested when she joined the military. Her father, retired Navy, who'd understood. Her sister, who thought space exploration was insane but loved her anyway.

They were living their lives in normal time. Linear, predictable, boring time. Where the past stayed past and the future waited its turn.

She envied them.

"Personal note: If temporal desync becomes permanent, request reassignment to ground duty. I won't risk becoming a liability to the crew."

Her hand blurred again. Present and future superimposed.

"End log."

Sarah lay on her bunk and closed her eyes. Sleep was difficult when your brain couldn't agree on how much time had passed. She'd taken sedatives after jump three. After jump four, even sedatives didn't help.

She thought about tomorrow's jump. The fifth breach of the light barrier. The fifth time her neurons would experience time at different rates.

Kenji was working on temporal shielding. Some way to keep the crew compartment locked in a stable timeframe during bubble collapse.

But that was theory. Tomorrow was practice.

Sarah drifted toward something like sleep. Dreams came fragmented, out of sequence. She was boarding the jump ship. She was emerging from jump five. She was talking to her mother. She was dead.

All simultaneously.

All equally real.

When she woke—if waking was the right word when sleep and consciousness blurred together—her clock said six hours had passed.

Her brain said twenty minutes.

Time to find out which one was lying.

And whether it mattered anymore.
