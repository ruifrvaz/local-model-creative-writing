Chen called break after four hours of negotiations. Both delegations had made genuine progress—outline agreement on mutual verification systems, preliminary framework for reducing military tensions, commitment to continued dialogue.

More than he'd dared hope for when talks began.

Yet the shadow of unknown attacks hung over everything.

He pulled Director Kim and Commander Osei aside after delegations dispersed for refreshment.

"We need to discuss Dr. Tanaka," he said quietly.

Kim's expression sharpened. "What about her?"

"Security has evidence suggesting she may be coordinating sabotage operations." Chen pulled up Lena's analysis. "Signal transmissions matching saboteur patterns, timeline correlations with attack preparations, technical capabilities required for sophisticated intelligence operation."

Kim looked at the data with expression Chen couldn't read. "You're accusing Coalition science advisor of terrorism?"

"I'm sharing information suggesting she's person of interest in ongoing investigation." Chen kept his voice level. "We haven't confronted her yet because premature action might trigger backup attack."

Osei reviewed the evidence. "Pattern is circumstantial but consistent. If she is coordinating attacks, she's shown professional discipline in maintaining cover."

"She's one of Coalition's most talented scientific minds," Kim said. "Recruited specifically for expertise in communications and systems analysis. Background checks were thorough."

"Which might make her perfect intelligence operative precisely because she appears beyond suspicion." Rafael joined the conversation. "Mars security recommends detention and interrogation."

"Based on incomplete evidence during critical negotiations?" Kim's voice hardened. "That's politically untenable."

"Leaving potential saboteur free during negotiations is operationally untenable," Rafael countered.

Chen watched the two security professionals facing off. Old tensions surfacing despite recent cooperation.

"There's middle option," he said. "We conduct controlled confrontation. Present the evidence, observe her reaction, be prepared to detain if she demonstrates hostile intent."

"And if she's innocent?" Kim asked. "We damage Coalition's credibility and potentially derail negotiations that are actually making progress."

"And if she's guilty and we wait, she triggers attack we can't prevent." Osei looked at the timeline. "How many attack vectors have we stopped? Three? Four? Sophisticated operation would have more redundancies."

Kim was quiet for long moment. "If we confront Tanaka, I want to be present. This is Coalition personnel, Coalition responsibility."

"Agreed," Chen said. "Rafael, Lena, prepare secure interrogation facility. Kim and I will conduct initial questioning with security backup ready."

They assembled in private office adjacent to conference room nine. Lena positioned security teams in corridor. Rafael coordinated Mars contingency response. Kim reviewed Coalition personnel files with expression suggesting she was questioning everything.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka entered the office with calm curiosity. "Director Kim, Ambassador Chen. Is there problem with negotiations?"

"Sit down, Dr. Tanaka," Chen said.

She sat, posture relaxed, eyes tracking between them with professional assessment.

Kim pulled up the evidence. "We've identified signal transmissions from Coalition quarters that match saboteur communication patterns. Transmitted during critical security incidents, including coordination of attack preparation this morning."

Tanaka examined the data. "These signals originated from shared technical equipment room. Multiple personnel have access."

"Access logs show you were present during two of three transmission windows." Chen highlighted the timeline. "And you have technical expertise to execute encrypted communications that appear legitimate while actually routing to hostile parties."

"I have expertise, access, and opportunity. That doesn't constitute proof." Tanaka's voice was measured. "What would constitute proof in your assessment?"

"Explanation for why you transmitted encrypted signal immediately after announcement about room four negotiations." Lena appeared in the doorway. "Signal that coordinated with device activation timeline in that facility."

Tanaka looked at Lena, then back to Kim. "I transmitted status report to Coalition intelligence. Standard security protocol during high-risk negotiations."

"Show us the message content," Kim said.

"It's classified. Coalition intelligence operations are not subject to Unity Station oversight."

"Unity Station security has authority over all communications related to sabotage investigations," Lena said. "Decrypt the message or we assume it's evidence of hostile coordination."

Tanaka stood slowly. "I don't respond well to ultimatums."

Lena's hand moved toward her sidearm. "Sit down, Doctor."

"Or what? You'll shoot Coalition science advisor during diplomatic negotiations?" Tanaka's expression was calm. "That would certainly disrupt talks more effectively than any sabotage operation."

Chen saw it then—the absolute confidence of someone who'd positioned themselves beyond consequence. Not innocent confusion. Controlled awareness.

"You're not just coordinating attacks," he said quietly. "You're the operation's architect."

Tanaka smiled slightly. "Prove it."

"Lena, detain Dr. Tanaka on suspicion of—"

The explosion cut Chen off. Not in the office. Somewhere close. The floor shook, alarms blared, atmospheric pressure fluctuated.

Conference room nine.

Chen's blood went cold. Both delegations had returned to that room during break. Dozens of people—

He ran. Lena was already moving, Kim and Rafael behind them. Emergency protocols activated, medical teams responding, chaos spreading through section nine.

Conference room nine's door was intact but smoke leaked around the edges. Chen overrode the lock and pulled it open.

Inside was devastation. The conference table was blown apart. Chairs scattered. Structural damage to walls and ceiling.

But no bodies.

The room was empty.

"Where are the delegations?" Kim demanded.

Marcus appeared on comm. "They evacuated thirty seconds before explosion. Emergency alert triggered from anonymous source, warned of device in room nine. Everyone cleared safely."

Chen felt confusion mixing with relief. "Who sent the alert?"

"Analyzing now. But Ambassador—the warning was transmitted from your personal terminal."

Chen's personal terminal. Which was in his office. The office where they'd left Dr. Tanaka under security watch.

They ran back. The office door was open. Security officers were unconscious on the floor. And Tanaka was gone.

Lena checked her officers. "Stunned. Non-lethal force. They'll recover."

"She disarmed two trained security officers?" Kim looked stunned.

"She's intelligence operative with combat training," Rafael said. "Probably been planning escape route since arriving at Unity."

Lena activated station-wide alert. "All personnel, Dr. Yuki Tanaka is hostile fugitive. Extremely dangerous. Detain on sight with extreme caution."

Chen pulled up his terminal logs. The evacuation warning had indeed been sent from his account. Thirty seconds before explosion—just enough time to clear room nine but not enough to disable the device.

"She saved the delegations," he said.

"Or she ensured her operation would fail without massive casualties," Kim said bitterly. "Impossible to determine intent."

"Why warn us?" Osei asked. "If goal was killing delegates, why prevent it?"

Chen reviewed the pattern. Multiple attack vectors, all discovered or prevented at last moment. Professional operation that seemed designed to fail.

"She wasn't trying to kill anyone," he said. "She was trying to create credible threat that would force Coalition and Mars to cooperate."

The implications settled over everyone.

"The sabotage attempts were theater," Rafael said slowly. "Sophisticated enough to seem genuine, positioned carefully enough to be discovered, timed precisely to create maximum pressure without actual casualties."

"And it worked." Kim looked at the evidence. "We've achieved more diplomatic progress in two days of crisis than we managed in months of formal negotiations."

"Because nothing motivates cooperation like common enemy." Chen pulled up the negotiation transcripts. "Every attack brought Coalition and Mars security closer together. Every shared threat reduced mutual suspicion."

"So Tanaka orchestrated this entire operation to force us to negotiate successfully?" Osei looked skeptical. "That's elaborate."

"It's also effective. Look at the agreement framework we developed." Chen highlighted the proposals. "Mutual verification systems, reduced military tensions, ongoing dialogue. All things both sides claimed were impossible yesterday."

Kim sat down heavily. "If you're right, if this was manufactured crisis designed to produce cooperation, then Tanaka's been conducting psychological operation against both governments."

"Not against. For." Chen reviewed the attack timeline. "Every device was positioned to be discovered. Every coerced operative was vulnerable to interrogation. Every backup plan had failure point built in. This was theater performed at state-intelligence level."

"To what end?" Rafael asked.

"To prevent actual war." Chen pulled up casualty projections—the same data he'd shown both delegations initially. "Fifty thousand dead in first week of real conflict. Someone decided diplomatic manipulation was justified to prevent that outcome."

Lena tracked Tanaka's movements through station surveillance. "She's heading toward docking facilities. Probably has escape vessel prepared."

"Let her go," Chen said.

Everyone stared at him.

"Ambassador, she's intelligence operative who conducted hostile operation aboard neutral station," Lena said. "We can't just let her leave."

"We can if stopping her means revealing that the entire sabotage threat was orchestrated to manipulate negotiations." Chen looked at Kim and Osei. "If your governments learn that someone manufactured this crisis, the cooperation we've built collapses. Trust is destroyed. The agreement framework becomes evidence of manipulation rather than genuine progress."

"You're suggesting we lie to our governments," Kim said.

"I'm suggesting we don't undermine fragile progress by revealing inconvenient truth." Chen pulled up the agreements. "These frameworks are sound. The cooperation is real, even if the threat that motivated it was theater. What matters more—pride or preventing war?"

Osei studied the proposals. "Mars government doesn't need to know the saboteur was actually trying to help. We report that security threats were identified and neutralized, negotiations proceeded successfully."

"Coalition will accept same narrative," Kim said slowly. "Especially since alternative is admitting we were manipulated by our own intelligence asset."

"Or someone else's asset using Coalition cover," Rafael suggested. "We still don't know who Tanaka actually works for."

Lena pulled up final surveillance. Tanaka boarding small transport vessel, docking clamps releasing, ship departing Unity Station.

Gone before anyone could intercept her.

Chen watched the vessel accelerate away from the station. Somewhere aboard was intelligence operative who'd risked her career and possibly her life to prevent war through manufactured crisis and psychological manipulation.

He couldn't decide if she was hero or villain.

Maybe she was both.

"We continue negotiations," he said. "Both delegations will be concerned about the explosion. We tell them the device was final sabotage attempt, neutralized through coordinated security effort between Coalition and Mars teams. Evidence of successful cooperation."

"Which is technically true," Osei said. "Just incomplete."

"Diplomacy is the art of strategic incompleteness." Chen moved toward conference room. "We have agreement framework to finalize. Can't let one explosion derail progress."

Kim and Osei exchanged glances. Some understanding passing between them.

"We'll support the narrative," Kim said. "Coalition delegation will emphasize security cooperation as model for broader agreements."

"Mars will do the same," Osei confirmed.

Chen returned to the damaged conference room. Maintenance crews were already repairing structural damage. Medical teams had confirmed no injuries—everyone evacuated in time.

Perfect outcome for operation designed to fail successfully.

He pulled up his notes and prepared to brief both delegations on the progress they'd made while surviving crisis that had been carefully orchestrated to ensure they'd make it.

Sometimes the truth was too complicated for diplomacy.

Sometimes lies served peace better than honesty served pride.

Chen had spent fifteen years learning which was which.

Today, he hoped he'd chosen correctly.
