The genetic analysis came back with concerning results. Dr. James Okoye presented them to the council with professional detachment that didn't hide his worry.

"Our population shows increasing expression of recessive disorders. Three new cases this year alone. Hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease. All genetic conditions that were rare in the founding generation."

"Genetic bottleneck effects," Dr. Eva Sato said. "We knew this was possible."

"Possible is now actual. And it's accelerating." Okoye pulled up projection models. "At current rates, twenty percent of births within three generations will show genetic disorders. Thirty percent within five generations."

The numbers hung in the chamber. Undeniable. Damning.

Captain Reyes spoke first. "Treatment options?"

"Gene therapy for some conditions. Palliative care for others. But we're not addressing the root cause—insufficient genetic diversity in our breeding population."

"We have eight thousand people," Engineer Nguyen protested. "That should be enough diversity."

"In theory. But our founders were selected for specific traits—intelligence, physical health, psychological resilience. That selection created clustering of certain genetic markers. We're more similar than a random population sample would be."

"Which means recessive alleles have higher probability of pairing," Eva said. "Basic genetics."

"Can we screen for carriers? Prevent affected pairings?" someone asked.

Okoye looked uncomfortable. "That would require mandatory genetic screening and breeding restrictions. Effectively government control of reproduction."

Silence. No one wanted to advocate for that level of control.

"Alternative approaches?" Reyes asked.

"Genetic diversity injection. We'd need to introduce new genetic material from outside our population." Okoye pulled up biological options. "Frozen embryo storage from Earth. Artificial insemination with donor material. Anything that broadens the gene pool."

"We left Earth three generations ago. Any stored material would be two hundred years old."

"Frozen embryos can remain viable for centuries if properly stored. The question is whether we have access." Okoye checked the ship's bio-storage manifests. "We do. The founders included embryo banks. Two thousand frozen embryos from diverse genetic backgrounds."

"Why weren't these deployed earlier?"

"The original mission profile assumed natural reproduction would provide sufficient diversity over four hundred years. The genetic counselors didn't anticipate the bottleneck effects this early."

Malik listened from the gallery. Genetic diversity through frozen embryos. Children born from parents who'd died two hundred years ago. It felt wrong somehow.

But the alternative was watching the population collapse from inherited diseases.

"We need to consider the social implications," Eva said. "Introducing embryos from Earth stock means children with no living parents. No genetic connection to current population. They'd be... outsiders."

"Or they'd be saviors," Okoye countered. "Fresh genetic material to prevent population collapse."

"Both can be true."

Reyes called for proposals. The council spent three weeks debating implementation. How many embryos to thaw. How to select host families. What support structures to provide.

The final decision: Controlled introduction of fifty embryos per year. Host families selected through volunteer lottery. Full community support for the children.

Malik watched the first embryo thaw with mixed feelings. The biological container was two hundred years old. The genetic material inside represented Earth humanity—people who'd never known space, never faced the void.

Would these children fit in? Would they be accepted?

The first birth happened six months later. A girl named Terra. Healthy. Genetically diverse. No carriers of the recessive disorders plaguing the ship-born population.

Her host family—the Chens—welcomed her with genuine affection. Not their genetic offspring, but their daughter nonetheless.

Malik met Terra when she was three. Bright, curious, completely unaware of her unusual origin.

"She's just a kid," Chen Wei said. "Doesn't matter where her genetics came from."

"But the genetics matter for the population."

"In abstract. In practice, she's our daughter. That's what's real."

Fifty more embryo births over the next year. Then fifty more. The program expanding as the community adapted.

Not everyone accepted it. Some saw the Earth-stock children as dilution of ship-born identity. Others worried about unknown genetic factors.

But the genetic diversity metrics improved. New allele combinations. Reduced recessive disorder expression. The population stabilizing.

Malik found himself mentoring several Earth-stock children as they grew. Helping them understand ship operations. Teaching them the engineering skills that kept eight thousand people alive.

They were quick learners. Unburdened by the multi-generational trauma of the journey. They saw the ship as home, not prison.

"Do you ever think about Earth?" one asked. A boy named Jian, twelve years old, brilliant with mechanical systems.

"I was born here. Earth is just history to me."

"My genetic parents lived there. Walked under open sky. Felt rain." Jian looked wistful. "I try to imagine it from the archives. Can't really grasp it."

"Neither can I. We're void-born. This is our reality."

"You ever regret it? Being born in space?"

Malik considered. "Can't regret what you never chose. But I'm grateful for it. We're building something unprecedented. A civilization between stars."

"Even if we never reach the destination?"

"The journey is the destination. We're proving humanity can survive beyond Earth. That matters."

Jian absorbed that. "Think the Earth-stock genetics will change ship culture?"

"Already changing it. Broader perspective. Different approaches to problems. It's good diversity."

Twenty years into the embryo program, the results were clear. Genetic disorder rates plateaued. Population viability projected for indefinite generations. The bottleneck crisis averted.

But social changes rippled through the community. Earth-stock children brought different values. Different assumptions. They questioned traditions the ship-born took for granted.

"Why do we maintain the original mission schedule?" one Earth-stock teenager asked at a community forum. "If we're self-sustaining, why not establish an orbital colony around a nearby star? Stop the constant transit?"

The suggestion was heretical. The mission was sacrosanct. Four hundred years to Kepler-442c. That was the purpose.

But the question prompted debate. Why continue to the original destination? What made Kepler-442c special besides being the plan?

Malik found himself defending tradition he'd questioned himself. "The mission gives us purpose. Direction. Without it, we're just drifting."

"We're already drifting. We're choosing to drift toward a specific destination." The teenager—Amara, sharp and uncompromising—pressed the point. "But that choice was made two hundred years ago by people who couldn't anticipate current circumstances."

"So we should abandon their plan?"

"We should adapt it. That's what intelligent beings do."

Reyes shut down the debate before it fractured the community. "The current mission parameters remain in effect. We're going to Kepler-442c. That's settled."

But the seed was planted. The Earth-stock children would grow up questioning. And eventually, they'd be the majority.

Eva found Malik in the Archive that evening.

"The embryo program worked," she said. "We saved the population."

"At what cost?" Malik gestured at the community feeds. "Social cohesion is fragmenting. The Earth-stock children don't share our values."

"They share humanity. That's enough." Eva pulled up demographic projections. "In three generations, Earth-stock genetics will dominate. They'll be the Covenant's culture. Ship-born traditions will be historical footnotes."

"That's cultural extinction."

"That's evolution. Cultures change or die. Ours is changing."

Malik wanted to argue. But Eva was right. The Covenant's culture had been shaped by centuries of isolation and shared purpose. Injecting Earth genetics meant injecting Earth perspectives.

The ship would survive. But the culture he'd known might not.

"Is that success?" he asked.

"Success is survival. Everything else is detail." Eva smiled sadly. "We saved the population. The cost is accepting that the population we saved will be different from us."

"Heavy price."

"Best price available."

Malik returned to his quarters. The ship hummed around him—life support, power systems, the thousand mechanisms of survival.

Eight thousand souls. Half ship-born. Half Earth-stock. All human.

The Covenant would reach its destination. Changed. Diversified. No longer the culture that had left Earth.

But alive.

That was the mission. Survival. Whatever form it took.

Malik could live with that.

He had to.
