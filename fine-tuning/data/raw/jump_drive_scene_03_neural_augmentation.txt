The jump sickness hit Lieutenant Sarah Chen thirty seconds after returning to normal space.

Nausea. Disorientation. Her vision swimming as her body tried to reconcile having aged twelve minutes while the universe aged only ten seconds.

Dr. Aisha Mbara was ready with anti-nausea medication and biometric scanners. "Heart rate elevated. Neural activity showing temporal stress markers. How do you feel?"

"Like I've been in two places at once." Sarah accepted the medication. "Is this getting worse?"

Aisha pulled up the comparison data. "Cellular aging is consistent with previous jumps. But neural stress markers are increasing. Your brain is having trouble processing the temporal differential."

"Can you fix it?"

"I can treat symptoms. But the root cause is fundamental—your consciousness exists in linear time. Jump drives violate that. Your brain rebels." Aisha highlighted the neural scans. "Each jump creates stress. Cumulative exposure may cause long-term effects."

"Define long-term."

"Memory issues, temporal disassociation, possible neurological degradation." Aisha's expression was grave. "Sarah, you're aging faster than normal and your brain is slowly failing to keep up. This isn't sustainable."

Dr. Kenji Yamamoto appeared in the medical bay, looking worried. "I overheard. Is it the asymmetric field geometry?"

"Possibly. Or it's just that humans aren't meant to experience time differently than their environment." Aisha pulled up theoretical models. "Our brains evolved in normal spacetime. FTL travel breaks that. Consequences are inevitable."

"Then we need to solve it," Kenji said. "Better shielding, neural support systems, something to help Sarah's brain process the temporal differential."

"Or we need a different test pilot," Aisha suggested.

Sarah sat up too quickly, regretted it immediately. "Not happening. I'm seeing this through."

"Sarah—"

"This is the future. FTL travel, contact with alien probes, expanding humanity's reach." Sarah met Aisha's eyes. "You think I'm going to quit because it's hard?"

"I think you're going to burn out your brain because you're stubborn."

"Probably. But that's a problem for future Sarah." She stood, steadied herself against the bed. "Present Sarah has another jump scheduled in forty-eight hours."

Admiral Kowalski entered the medical bay, having clearly been monitoring the conversation. "Lieutenant Chen, Dr. Mbara has medical authority here. If she grounds you—"

"She won't," Sarah interrupted. "Because she knows I'm the best pilot we have. And because the mission is more important than one person's health."

"That's exactly backwards," Aisha said. "The mission fails if the pilot dies."

"Then keep me alive long enough to complete it." Sarah pulled up the test schedule. "We're building the investigation ship—Curiosity. Six months until launch. I can last six months."

"Can you?" Aisha challenged. "Each jump causes cumulative damage. Six months of testing means sixty, maybe eighty more jumps. Your neural stress markers might be critical by then."

"Might be. Not definitely." Sarah looked at Kenji. "Can you develop neural support technology in six months?"

"I can try. But that's experimental, untested—"

"Everything we're doing is experimental and untested. That's the point." Sarah headed for the door. "Let me know what you come up with."

After she left, Aisha turned to Kowalski. "Admiral, I'm formally recommending we suspend jump testing until we develop better protective measures."

"Recommendation noted. Request denied." Kowalski pulled up the mission parameters. "Earth Command wants FTL capability operational. Lieutenant Chen is willing to continue. We proceed."

"Even if it kills her?"

"Even if it costs her health. She's military. She understands sacrifice." Kowalski's expression softened slightly. "But Dr. Yamamoto, if you can develop neural protection, do it. I'd prefer to keep our test pilot alive."

Kenji spent the next month buried in neurological research. Brain-computer interfaces, temporal stress mitigation, neural augmentation possibilities.

He consulted with neuroscientists, AI researchers, medical device engineers. Looking for anything that might help Sarah's brain process temporal differential without degrading.

The answer came from an unexpected source: quantum neural networks.

"The human brain is essentially quantum," Kenji explained to Aisha. "Neurons processing information through quantum states, collapsing probability into decision. What if we support that process artificially?"

"You want to augment Sarah's brain with quantum computing?"

"Not replace. Support. Give her neural system additional processing capacity to handle temporal stress." Kenji pulled up the theoretical framework. "Small quantum processors, implanted near major neural centers, helping her brain manage the temporal differential."

"That's radical neurosurgery."

"That's survival technology." Kenji showed her the simulations. "With quantum neural support, Sarah's brain could process temporal differential without stress. Jump sickness would decrease. Long-term damage would be minimized."

"And the risks?"

"Unknown. This has never been attempted." Kenji met her eyes. "But doing nothing means watching Sarah deteriorate. I'd rather try experimental intervention than guaranteed failure."

They presented the proposal to Sarah and Kowalski together.

Sarah's response was immediate: "Do it. When can we start?"

"The implants need three weeks to fabricate. Surgery takes six hours. Recovery is two weeks minimum." Kenji pulled up the timeline. "You'd miss several test jumps."

"I'll catch up." Sarah studied the neural interface specs. "This is quantum computing directly in my brain?"

"Integrated with your existing neural architecture. Not controlling, just supporting. Helping you process information that human brains weren't designed to handle."

Sarah considered. "Will I still be me? Or am I becoming part machine?"

"You're already part machine in one sense—your brain uses electrical signals, chemical reactions, quantum states. This just adds computational support." Kenji pulled up the integration model. "Think of it like glasses for your neurons. Corrective technology, not replacement."

"Glasses that process temporal differential using quantum mechanics. Sure. Totally normal." Sarah smiled. "Let's do it."

The surgery was complex. Kenji working with Aisha and a surgical AI, placing quantum processors at precise neural locations. Temporal processing centers. Memory consolidation areas. Conscious awareness regions.

Sarah was awake for most of it—neural surgery required patient feedback. Kenji tested each implant, verified integration, ensured proper function.

"I can feel them," Sarah said during the procedure. "Like extra thoughts. Parallel processing."

"That's the quantum support coming online. Does it hurt?"

"No. It's just... strange. Like thinking in two directions simultaneously."

"That's temporal processing. Your brain learning to use the new capabilities." Kenji completed the final implant. "We're done. How do you feel?"

"Like I have a migraine and cosmic awareness at the same time." Sarah closed her eyes. "Is that normal?"

"For experimental quantum neural augmentation? Probably." Aisha administered recovery medication. "Rest now. We'll monitor integration over the next two weeks."

The integration was remarkable. Sarah's brain adapted to the quantum processors faster than predicted. Within a week, she was thinking faster, processing complex information more efficiently, experiencing time in slightly non-linear ways.

"It's like I can feel the future," she tried to explain. "Not see it. Just sense probability branches, potential outcomes."

"That's quantum coherence," Kenji said. "Your brain accessing probability states before collapse. Normal human consciousness can't do that."

"So I'm not normal human consciousness anymore?"

"You're enhanced human consciousness. Still you. Just more capable."

The first post-surgery jump test was scheduled two weeks after surgery.

Sarah climbed into the test cockpit feeling different. More aware. More prepared.

The jump felt smooth. Almost natural. Her augmented brain processing the temporal differential without stress.

When she emerged, there was no nausea. No disorientation. Just clean transition from jump space to normal space.

"Jump sickness?" Aisha asked.

"Gone. I felt the time differential, but it didn't bother me. Like my brain just... understood it." Sarah pulled up her biometrics. "Neural stress markers?"

"Minimal. Cellular aging still present—ten minutes relative to eight seconds real-time. But no neural degradation." Aisha looked amazed. "Sarah, it worked. The quantum augmentation is protecting your brain."

"So I can keep jumping."

"You can keep jumping without destroying yourself." Aisha pulled up the long-term projections. "You'll still age faster. But your consciousness will remain intact."

Sarah felt relief flood through her. The mission could continue. Curiosity would launch. First contact would happen.

And she'd be there. Whole. Functional. Enhanced.

Ready for whatever the universe held.

One quantum thought at a time.
