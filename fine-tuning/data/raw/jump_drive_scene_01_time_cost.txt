Lieutenant Sarah Chen woke up screaming.

The medical bay lights were too bright. The walls were the wrong color. Her body felt wrong—lighter somehow, younger.

"Easy." Dr. Mbara's hands pressed her shoulders down. "You're safe. You're back."

Back from where? Sarah's memories cascaded in fragments. The jump test. Entering the Alcubierre bubble. The universe compressing to a singularity behind her and expanding into infinite possibility ahead.

And then... nothing. Just the terrible sensation of existing in every moment simultaneously.

"How long?" Her voice cracked.

"Forty-seven minutes subjective. Three weeks objective." Mbara checked her vitals. "You came through better than the last test pilot. No major cellular damage, minimal temporal displacement."

Three weeks. Sarah had experienced less than an hour. The numbers didn't add up. Couldn't add up. But her reflection in the medical bay's mirror showed the truth—she looked exactly as she had forty-seven minutes ago. Not three weeks older. Not aged at all.

"The others?" she asked.

Mbara's expression tightened. "Dr. Yamamoto wants to debrief you first."

Which meant the others hadn't made it back. Or had come back wrong. Sarah had heard the rumors about the early jump tests. Pilots who returned with their organs reversed. Bodies that were biologically twenty years older than when they'd left. One test subject who came back pregnant despite being male.

FTL travel didn't just bend space. It bent reality itself.

"Get me Kenji," Sarah said, sitting up despite Mbara's protests. "I need to tell him what I saw."

Twenty minutes later, she was in the observation deck. Dr. Yamamoto looked worse than she felt—hollow-eyed, his hair grayer than she remembered. Three weeks of waiting would do that.

"Lieutenant Chen." His voice was formal. Professional. Hiding the relief underneath. "Please describe your experience inside the bubble."

Sarah thought about how to explain the unexplainable. "Time didn't flow. It... pooled. Like I was standing in every second between departure and arrival simultaneously."

"Did you experience physical discomfort?"

"I experienced everything. Thirst, hunger, exhaustion, renewal. All at once. My body was trying to metabolize forty-seven minutes of life and three weeks of stasis in the same moment." She touched her face, still feeling wrong in her own skin. "I think I lived those three weeks. Somewhere. But I don't remember them."

Yamamoto made notes on his tablet. "The navigation computer recorded your bio-signs throughout the jump. Your heart beat exactly two thousand eight hundred twenty times. Standard for a forty-seven minute interval. But your cellular markers show three weeks of aging. The telomeres shortened. Your body experienced the full duration even though your consciousness didn't."

"So I'm losing time. Every jump costs me the objective duration, not the subjective one."

"Yes. And we don't know the cumulative effects yet. You're the first pilot to complete three successful jumps." Yamamoto pulled up her medical history. "Your biological age is now three months older than your chronological age."

Sarah absorbed that. Three jumps. Three months of her life, gone. If they scaled this up to commercial use, if jump drives became standard, pilots would age decades while the rest of the universe moved forward.

"The other test subjects," she said. "What happened to them?"

Yamamoto hesitated. "Lieutenant Marcus experienced severe temporal displacement. His biological age and chronological age diverged by seventeen years. He's currently in medical isolation."

"He's seventeen years older after one jump?"

"He's seventeen years younger. His body de-aged. We don't understand why." Yamamoto closed the file. "Ensign Rodriguez didn't make it back. The jump bubble collapsed during transit. We recovered the ship, but..."

He didn't need to finish. Sarah had seen the projections. A body caught between quantum states when the bubble failed would experience every possible outcome simultaneously. Schrodinger's pilot. Alive and dead and everything in between.

"You want to know if I'll jump again," Sarah said.

"I want to know if you can. Psychologically. Physically." Yamamoto met her eyes. "Admiral Kowalski is pushing for operational deployment. He wants jump-capable ships in production within six months. But we can't deploy a technology we don't understand. And we can't ask pilots to age themselves to death one jump at a time."

Sarah looked out at the stars. Earth was visible in the distance, a blue marble against the black. They'd jumped from lunar orbit to Mars orbit in forty-seven minutes. The conventional transit would have taken six months.

The math was compelling. The cost was terrifying.

"I'll jump again," she said. "But not until we understand the aging variance. If I'm going to burn years of my life, I need to know it's for something that won't kill the next pilot who tries it."

"Agreed. I'm recommending we suspend testing until—"

"Dr. Yamamoto." Admiral Kowalski's voice cut through the observation deck's speakers. "Report to Command immediately. We have a situation."

Yamamoto and Sarah exchanged looks. "Situation" in military speak meant everything from paperwork errors to existential threats. The tone suggested the latter.

They reached Command to find Kowalski staring at a tactical display. Ships. Dozens of them. All bearing toward Earth at velocities that conventional drives couldn't match.

"They jumped," Kowalski said without preamble. "Someone else has FTL capability. And they're not bothering with test flights."

Sarah felt her stomach drop. "Who?"

"Unknown. The signatures don't match any known faction. But they'll be in Earth orbit in six hours." Kowalski turned to face them. "We have three jump-capable ships. Yours, Chen, is the only one with a pilot currently fit for duty."

"Sir, with respect, we don't know the long-term effects—"

"We know that an unknown force with superior technology is heading for Earth. And we know you can intercept them before they arrive." Kowalski's expression was stone. "I'm not asking, Lieutenant. I'm ordering."

Sarah looked at Yamamoto. The scientist's face was pale. He knew what this meant. Rushing into another jump without recovery time. Stacking temporal displacement on top of existing damage. Potentially aging herself years in a single day.

But the alternative was letting an unknown force reach Earth unopposed.

"How many jumps to intercept?" she asked.

"Four. Maybe five, depending on their approach vector."

Four jumps. Four months of aging, minimum. Maybe more if the variance worked against her. She could be biologically forty by the time she got back, even if only days passed for everyone else.

"I'll need Dr. Mbara on board. And full medical monitoring." Sarah straightened her uniform. "And sir? When this is over, we're having a serious conversation about pilot expendability."

Kowalski almost smiled. "When this is over, Lieutenant, you'll be too valuable to argue with. Dismissed."

Sarah headed for the docking bay. Yamamoto caught up with her.

"You don't have to do this," he said quietly.

"Yes, I do. Because if I don't, someone else will. And they might not come back at all." She stopped at the airlock. "Just promise me something. Whatever data you get from my jumps, use it. Make the next generation safer. Don't let pilots burn themselves out because we were too impatient to understand what we'd built."

"I promise," Yamamoto said. "And Sarah? Come back. However old you are, just come back."

She nodded and cycled through the airlock.

The jump ship waited. Small. Fast. Built for one purpose only—to punch holes in reality and hope the universe didn't notice.

Sarah climbed into the pilot seat and initiated pre-flight.

Four jumps. Four months. Four chances to save Earth or die trying.

She'd faced worse odds.

At least, she thought she had. It was hard to remember clearly. The jumps were already blurring her timeline.

"Chen to Command. Ready for jump sequence."

"Acknowledged. Good luck, Lieutenant."

Sarah engaged the drive and felt reality begin to compress.

Here we go again, she thought.

And then time stopped making sense.
