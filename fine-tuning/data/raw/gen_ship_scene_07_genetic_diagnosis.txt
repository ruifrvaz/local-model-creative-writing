Dr. Eva Sato stood in the ship's library, cataloging physical books for the third time this year. Every volume had to be assessed for preservation priority. Paper degraded slowly but inevitably. Even with climate control and careful handling, they'd lose content over time.

Her tablet chimed. Priority message from Medical.

*Genetic screening results. Your office. Private.*

Eva's chest tightened. She'd submitted her own genetic profile last week as part of the comprehensive diversity assessment. Every crew member was being tested now, cataloging the full scope of their genetic challenges.

She found Dr. Okoye waiting in her small office, his expression carefully neutral. The doctor's professional mask that meant bad news delivered gently.

"Show me."

Okoye pulled up the results. Eva's genetic profile displayed in layers—ancestry, health markers, hereditary risk factors. He highlighted a sequence in red.

"You carry markers for Huntington's disease. Genetic analysis suggests forty percent probability of symptom onset between ages forty and fifty."

Eva was forty-two.

The words didn't fully register at first. Just data on a screen. Then the implications cascaded. Huntington's. Progressive neurodegeneration. Motor control loss, cognitive decline, personality changes. No cure. No treatment. Just inevitable deterioration.

"I feel fine," she said stupidly.

"Symptoms can be subtle early on. Slight coordination issues, mood changes, memory lapses. Often attributed to stress or aging." Okoye pulled up a cognitive assessment. "I'd like you to complete some tests. Establish a baseline for monitoring."

"How long?"

"If you're symptomatic now, which we don't know yet, the progression varies. Ten to twenty years typically."

Ten to twenty years. Less than the time to reach Tau Ceti. She might deteriorate significantly before they ever arrived. Might become dependent on care she couldn't provide herself. Might lose the very cognition that made her who she was.

"Does this affect my ability to do my job?"

Okoye hesitated. "Not immediately. But if symptoms progress, yes. You'd need to transition to less demanding work. Eventually—"

"Eventually I become a burden on limited medical resources." Eva finished the thought. "How many others have similar diagnoses?"

"Forty-seven crew members show markers for serious hereditary conditions. Yours is among the more severe." He pulled up the population data. "This is exactly what I warned about with genetic diversity loss. Recessive disorders appearing at higher frequencies, genetic diseases clustering in families, the population-level impacts of limited diversity."

Eva felt anger rising. Not at Okoye. At the situation. At the mission planners who'd underestimated the genetic challenges. At the radiation event that destroyed their backup diversity. At herself for existing.

"I'm a genetic dead end," she said flatly. "I shouldn't reproduce."

"That's a personal choice. But yes, passing this marker to children would be—problematic."

Eva pulled up her family tree. Three generations on the ship. Her grandmother, her mother, herself. The Sato line had always been small. Now it would end with her.

"My mother didn't have symptoms," Eva said. "She lived to sixty-eight. Died in a maintenance accident, not from disease."

"She may have carried the markers without expressing them. Or you inherited this from your father's line. Genetic lottery. It doesn't always manifest."

"Until it does." Eva closed the display. "Who else knows about this?"

"Just me. Medical confidentiality. You can disclose to whomever you choose."

"And if I become symptomatic? If I can't perform my duties?"

"We'll manage it case by case. The archive is important, but it's not life-critical. We have backup personnel who can take over if needed."

If needed. When needed. Eva was the third-generation archivist, trained from childhood in preservation and cultural continuity. She'd dedicated her life to maintaining humanity's knowledge, preparing it for the moment when they'd finally have a world to build.

And now she might not be there to see it.

"I need time to process this," she said.

Okoye nodded. "Take whatever time you need. But I do recommend starting the cognitive assessments soon. Early detection gives us more treatment options."

After he left, Eva sat alone in her office. The walls lined with books—physical, precious, irreplaceable. Knowledge that had survived wars, disasters, the collapse of civilizations. Now preserved on a ship hurtling through space, maintained by a woman who might lose the capacity to understand what she was protecting.

Her tablet chimed again. Captain Reyes requesting a meeting about archive priorities. The crew was still processing the decision to continue to Tau Ceti. Resources needed to be reallocated, redundancies eliminated, survival prioritized over sentiment.

Eva pulled up her archive catalog. Fifteen thousand volumes. Digital copies existed, but the physical books mattered. They represented tangible connection to Earth, to human history, to cultures that might not exist anymore.

How many would they sacrifice for practical survival?

How many could she justify protecting while knowing her own cognition might fail?

She thought about the referendum. She'd voted to continue the mission. Argued passionately for preserving cultural continuity and honoring the original purpose. Now that choice meant she'd likely deteriorate while the ship traveled on, unable to complete the work she'd dedicated herself to.

Was the mission still worth it?

Her comm chimed. Sofia Chen, Malik's wife.

"Eva, do you have time to talk? In person?"

"Sure. My office."

Sofia arrived ten minutes later, noticeably pregnant now. Seven months along. The baby would arrive in two months—the first child born since the referendum vote.

"I heard about the genetic screening," Sofia said. "Okoye told me you might need support."

"Medical confidentiality—"

"I'm a medical technician. I see all the screening results. I'm sorry, Eva."

Eva felt the careful walls she'd built starting to crack. Sofia was younger, optimistic, carrying new life into an uncertain future. The contrast with Eva's own diagnosis was sharp.

"I'm forty-two," Eva said. "I've had a good life. Meaningful work. Purpose. If I only have ten or twenty more years, that's still—"

"Still not enough." Sofia sat across from her. "You're allowed to be angry about this."

"Anger doesn't change genetics."

"No. But it's human. You can be logical and emotional simultaneously. I learned that from Malik. He runs structural analysis constantly while also caring desperately about outcomes."

Eva smiled slightly. "How is Malik handling the pressure?"

"By working eighteen-hour days and pretending he's not terrified about bringing a child into this situation." Sofia placed a hand on her stomach. "We almost didn't have children. After the referendum, after seeing all the data about genetic diversity and structural failure. But then we decided that fear wasn't a good enough reason to stop living."

"Your daughter might inherit problems from the limited gene pool."

"Probably. But she'll also inherit purpose, community, and the knowledge that she's part of something important. That has to count for something."

Eva pulled up her own genetic results, showed them to Sofia. "This is what she might inherit. This is the legacy of limited diversity and random genetic expression. Are you prepared for that?"

Sofia studied the data. "I'm prepared to love her and support her and give her the best life possible in whatever circumstances exist. That's all any parent can do."

"Even if those circumstances are catastrophic neurodegeneration?"

"Even then. Because the alternative is giving up. Deciding that imperfect life isn't worth living. And I don't believe that."

Eva felt tears threatening. She'd been so focused on cataloging, preserving, maintaining—she'd forgotten to consider her own fragility. Her own mortality. Her own right to grieve what she might lose.

"I don't want to lose myself," she admitted. "My mind is who I am. Huntington's takes that. Slowly, progressively, inevitably. I'll become someone I don't recognize."

"Then we'll make sure you're not alone. That you're supported. That your work continues even if you can't personally complete it."

"The archive—"

"Will be maintained. I'll help. Malik will help. We'll train people. Your knowledge won't be lost even if your capacity changes."

Eva wanted to believe that. Wanted to trust that her life's work would persist beyond her individual deterioration. But the archive felt so personal, so connected to her family's legacy.

"My grandmother used to say that books survive because people care about them," Eva said. "Not because they're indestructible, but because each generation chooses to preserve them. That's what we are. Choosers. Preservers."

"And you've chosen well. You've preserved knowledge that would have been lost. You've maintained cultural continuity across generations. That work matters, Eva. It'll continue mattering after you."

The tears came now. Not dramatic sobbing, just quiet grief for the future she'd imagined and would now have to revise. The career she'd planned. The contributions she'd hoped to make. The satisfaction of seeing the archive successfully delivered to Tau Ceti.

Sofia moved to sit beside her, offered silent support. Sometimes that was enough. Presence without platitudes. Witness without judgment.

"I need to tell Reyes," Eva said finally. "About the diagnosis. It affects my ability to serve as archivist long-term."

"She'll support you. She values your work even when she disagrees with your positions."

"I argued for continuing the mission. Now I'm one of the casualties of that choice."

"You're not a casualty yet. You might not develop symptoms for years. Decades even. Genetic markers aren't destiny."

"No. But they're probability. And I need to be realistic about planning."

Eva pulled up her succession documents. She'd prepared them years ago—standard practice for anyone in a critical role. Now she'd need to update them with medical realities, accelerated timelines, contingency plans for cognitive decline.

"Will you help me?" Eva asked. "Train backup archivists, document preservation protocols, ensure continuity if I become unable to serve?"

"Of course. Whatever you need."

They spent the next hour reviewing the archive systems, identifying critical knowledge that needed to be transferred, creating training schedules for potential successors. Practical work. Manageable tasks. Steps toward accepting a future Eva didn't want but couldn't avoid.

When Sofia left, Eva returned to the library. The physical books surrounded her, silent and patient. They'd survived longer than any individual human. Would continue surviving as long as people chose to protect them.

She pulled down *The Odyssey*—her grandmother's favorite. Opened to a passage about homecoming, about journeys that exceed their travelers' lifespans, about purposes larger than individuals.

The mission would continue. With or without her. With or without any specific person.

That was the point. That was why they'd voted to persist despite the odds.

Because some things mattered more than individual survival.

Eva just hadn't expected to embody that truth so literally.

She returned the book to its climate-controlled case and began cataloging the next shelf.

Work continued. Life continued. The mission continued.

Even when individual lives didn't.

Especially then.
