The claim jumpers hit at 0412 hours. No warning, no negotiation. Just three ships appearing from behind asteroid cover with weapons hot.

Kayla's alarm woke Captain Jax from uneasy sleep. "Boss, we've got hostile contacts. They're demanding we abandon the Lucky Strike and current mining claim."

Jax was on the command deck in thirty seconds. The tactical display showed three vessels in attack formation—better armed than the Lucky Strike, better positioned, clearly experienced at this kind of piracy.

"Broadcast our independent registration. We're legal operators with filed claims."

The response came back cold. "Don't care about your claims. We want this asteroid and your ship. You can leave in your emergency pod or leave in pieces. Your choice."

Wrench pulled up weapon systems. "Our fusion torch could maybe damage one of them if we get close. Our mass driver has no targeting capability against maneuvering ships. We're badly outgunned."

"What about defenses?"

"Minimal. We sacrificed armor for cargo capacity when we bought this ship. One sustained hit from their weapons and we're compromised."

Sofia ran probabilities. "If we abandon ship, we survive. If we fight, we probably die. Math says we run."

Jax looked at his crew. Three years of work. All their equipment, all their exotic matter, all their future—sitting in this ship. Walking away meant starting over with nothing.

"There's a third option. We call for help."

"From who? Corporate response teams take hours. Independent miners nearby might not want to get involved."

"We call everyone. Broadcast distress on all frequencies. Make this very public. Claim jumpers operate quietly. They don't like witnesses."

Kayla activated the emergency beacon. "All vessels, this is independent miner Lucky Strike. We are under attack by claim jumpers at coordinates seven-seven-delta-four-nine. Requesting immediate assistance from any independent vessels in range."

The jumper ships shifted, clearly uncomfortable with the broadcast.

"Shut that down or we open fire."

"Negative. We're exercising our legal right to request assistance. You open fire, you escalate from claim jumping to murder. That brings Belt Authority down hard."

"Belt Authority doesn't care about independents."

"They care about maintaining order. Murder investigations are bad for business. You really want to cross that line?"

The jumpers held position. Calculating. Weighing options.

Jax kept talking, buying time. "You want the asteroid? It's low-grade nickel-iron. Worth maybe thirty thousand credits. You want our ship? It's fifteen years old, barely functional, held together with improvisation. Worth less than scrap value. What exactly are you hoping to gain here?"

One of the jumper ships moved closer. Its captain opened a direct channel.

"We know what you have. Exotic matter. Worth millions. Hand it over, you can keep your ship and your lives."

So that was it. Someone had talked. Leaked information about the Lucky Strike's exotic matter supply.

"We don't have exotic matter. Just standard ore."

"Don't lie. We've got intelligence from Freeport. You sold exotic samples three weeks ago. That means you have more."

Jax felt cold. Their network had been compromised. Someone at Freeport had sold them out.

"Even if we had exotic matter, you think we'd just hand it over? Without fight?"

"We think you're smart enough to know when you're beaten. Give us the exotic matter, we let you go. Refuse, we take it from your wreckage."

Wrench was running calculations. "Boss, we've got maybe two minutes before they lose patience and open fire. Need a decision."

Jax pulled up the exotic matter storage. They had about thirty kilograms left after selling for Kayla's father's treatment. Enough to rebuild their operation but not enough to die for.

Maybe.

"If we give them the exotic matter," Sofia said quietly, "we're back to zero. All that risk, all that work, for nothing."

"If we don't, we're dead. Zero is better than dead."

Kayla's console chimed. "Boss, I'm getting responses to the distress call. Two independent vessels are changing course to our position. ETA twelve minutes."

"Tell the jumpers we've got help coming. See if that changes their calculation."

Jax opened the channel. "Your twelve-minute window is closing. Independent vessels are en route. You want to be here when they arrive?"

"They won't interfere. Independents don't risk themselves for strangers."

"You willing to bet on that?"

The jumpers hesitated. Three against one was easy math. Three against three with potential witnesses was different calculation entirely.

"Final offer," the jumper captain said. "Exotic matter, now, or we start shooting."

Jax looked at his crew. Saw determination, fear, anger. They'd worked too hard to give it up without fight.

But survival beat pride.

"Stand by. We're transferring the exotic matter to cargo pod. You can retrieve it after we've cleared the area."

"Smart choice."

Wrench moved to prepare the transfer. But his hands were shaking with rage. "We're just giving up?"

"We're staying alive to fight another day. Load the cargo pod with twenty kilograms of exotic matter. Keep ten hidden in the emergency compartment."

"They'll scan for that."

"Maybe. But their scanners aren't as good as they think. We shield the storage properly, they might miss it."

While Wrench prepared the cargo pod, Kayla kept the distress beacon active. The responding ships were closing—eight minutes now.

The jumpers were getting nervous. "Transfer's taking too long. Move faster."

"Can't rush pressurization cycles. Unless you want explosive decompression when you retrieve the pod."

Finally, the cargo pod was ready. Jax released it, watching twenty kilograms of exotic matter drift toward the jumper ships.

"There's your score. Now back off and let us go."

The jumpers retrieved the pod, scanned it, confirmed the exotic matter. Then, surprisingly, they withdrew.

"Pleasure doing business. Maybe hide your valuable finds better next time."

After they'd cleared the sector, the responding independent ships arrived. Two mining vessels, armed well enough to have made the jumpers think twice about fighting.

"Lucky Strike, this is the Independence. You okay?"

"We're intact. Lost some cargo to claim jumpers but we're alive."

"Sorry we couldn't get here faster. But word's spreading—independents are organizing rapid response networks. Next time someone broadcasts distress, we'll have ships in position faster."

After the rescue ships departed, Jax pulled his crew together.

"We lost most of our exotic matter. But we kept ten kilograms and we kept our lives. That's a win."

"Doesn't feel like a win," Wrench said.

"Because it's not. It's survival. But survival gives us chance to try again."

Sofia pulled up financial projections. "Ten kilograms of exotic matter, plus our current ore contracts, gives us about six months of operations. Enough to rebuild some capability."

"And now we know someone at Freeport sold us out. Need to be more careful about who we trust."

Kayla was monitoring the independent network. "The rapid response ships are organizing. Setting up patrols, coordination protocols. Claim jumping is becoming harder."

"Good. Maybe independents are finally learning to work together."

Jax looked at the asteroid where they'd almost died. The mining claim was still theirs. The exotic matter was mostly gone. The ship was intact.

They'd survived. That was enough.

For now.

Always for now.

But they'd try again tomorrow.

Same as always.

A little wiser. A little more cautious.

Still fighting.

Still free.

Still refusing to give up, even when the odds said they should.

That was the independent way.

And they wouldn't trade it for anything.
