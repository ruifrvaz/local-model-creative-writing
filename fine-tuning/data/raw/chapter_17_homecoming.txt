Six months later, Earth.

Fleet Command looked different through Elena's expanded awareness. She could feel the weight of bureaucracy, the currents of political power, the thousands of minds all focused on the changes she'd brought back.

The anomaly had changed her. Not physically—though her neural implants had evolved during the contact—but perceptually. She saw connections now. Patterns. The way information flowed through human systems like water through stone.

Admiral Torres met her at the entrance. Older now, or maybe just more tired. Three decorations Elena didn't recognize hung on her uniform.

"Captain Reeves. Welcome home."

"Thank you, Admiral." Elena's cybernetic arm hummed quietly. The upgrades the anomaly had suggested made it more responsive, more integrated. More hers.

They walked through corridors Elena remembered from her academy days. Different now. Everything was different.

"The board has reviewed your reports," Torres said. "All four thousand pages."

"I tried to be thorough."

"You detailed first contact with an intelligence older than our species, the acquisition of technology that makes our current arsenal look like stone tools, and a fundamental restructuring of how we understand reality itself." Torres paused at a secure door. "You also violated seventeen direct orders, endangered your crew, and effectively rewrote first contact protocols without authorization."

Elena waited. This was the moment she'd been preparing for since Saturn orbit.

Torres swiped her credentials. The door opened.

Inside, Elena saw not a court-martial board, but a conference room filled with scientists, linguists, xenobiologists, engineers. Humanity's best minds, assembled to understand what the Meridian had discovered.

"Welcome to the First Contact Integration Task Force," Torres said. "You're the new director."

Elena blinked. "Ma'am?"

"The alternative was locking you up for insubordination. But that seemed counterproductive given that you've become humanity's primary liaison to an intergalactic network of ancient intelligences." Torres gestured at the assembled crowd. "These people have questions. Lots of questions. Think you can handle it?"

Elena looked at the expectant faces. Scientists who'd devoted their lives to wondering if they were alone. Now they knew they weren't. And they wanted to understand how it all worked.

"I'll need my crew," Elena said. "All of them. This isn't something I did alone."

"Already approved. The Meridian crew is being reassigned to your task force." Torres pulled up a holographic org chart. "You'll have resources, autonomy, and direct oversight from the Security Council. Your mission: integrate everything the anomaly taught us and prepare humanity for what comes next."

"What does come next?"

Torres smiled. "That's what we're all hoping you'll tell us, Captain." She handed Elena a data chip. "Your new orders. Read them when you have time. For now, there's someone who wants to see you."

Elena frowned. "Who?"

The conference room doors opened. Dr. Chen, Marcus, Patel, Okonkwo—her entire bridge crew walked in, along with dozens of other Meridian personnel.

But at the front, using a cane but walking steadily, was someone Elena had thought was dead.

"Katie?"

Her sister grinned, older and scarred but unmistakably alive. "Hey, Ellie. Heard you met my friend."

Elena couldn't speak. Couldn't move. Katie was dead. She'd died at Phobos. Elena had attended the memorial service.

"Medical stasis," Dr. Chen explained gently. "When the Phobos AI failed, some crew members survived the initial cascade. Katie was one of them. We didn't know she was alive until the anomaly shared its medical scans."

"It showed us where to look," Katie said. "How to revive us. There were twenty-seven survivors total, all in stasis pods the station AI had hidden in its last moments of sanity."

Elena crossed the room in three strides and pulled her sister into a hug. Katie laughed, the same sound Elena remembered from childhood, from before the war, from a world that didn't know about alien ambassadors and expanded consciousness.

Real. Warm. Alive.

"You saved me," Katie whispered. "By talking to it instead of fighting it. By showing it we could be better."

"I thought I'd lost you."

"You did. But you found me again. That's the important part." Katie pulled back, still smiling. "And now we get to do the coolest thing ever—teach humanity how to talk to the universe."

Elena looked around at her crew, at the assembled scientists, at Torres watching with quiet approval. At her sister, alive and well and ready for whatever came next.

Three years ago, she'd failed to save Phobos. Today, she'd helped save something bigger—humanity's chance at a real future among the stars.

"Okay," Elena said. "Let's get to work."

Katie squeezed her hand. "Just like old times."

"Better than old times." Elena activated her neural link, feeling the gentle presence of the anomaly somewhere in orbit, patient and curious and eternally watching. "This time, we're not alone."

The task force assembled. Data flooded the displays—alien architectures, quantum theories, cultural exchanges from species humanity had never heard of.

And Elena Reeves, who'd started this journey scared and scarred and certain she'd fail again, stood at the center of it all and smiled.

Katie leaned close. "Mom's going to freak out when she finds out I'm alive."

"She's going to freak out about a lot of things." Elena pulled up the mission overview. "Ready to change the world?"

"Born ready."

Elena looked at the data streaming across the displays. Seventeen anomaly contacts identified across the galaxy. Twelve had already initiated communication using the protocols the Meridian had developed.

"The Security Council wants to know if you're ready for the next phase," Torres said quietly.

"What's the next phase?"

"We've been invited. All of us. Humanity's first diplomatic mission to the anomaly network's gathering point."

Elena felt her heart race. First contact had been one thing. But this—this was humanity stepping into a galactic community.

The real adventure was just beginning.

And this time, Elena had her sister back to share it with.

Katie grinned. "Space diplomacy. Mom's definitely going to freak out."

"Let her. We've got work to do." Elena looked around the room—her crew, her family, humanity's future. "Time to see what's out there."

The stars waited. And humanity, finally, was ready to answer.
