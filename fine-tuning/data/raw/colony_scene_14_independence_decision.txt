The solar array came online at dawn. Alexis watched the power readings climb from the engineering console, satisfaction warming her chest.

Twenty percent increase in generation capacity. Enough to support the colony's growth for another two years.

"Congratulations," Reeves said from behind her. "The array's more efficient than corporate's projections."

"Corporate's projections didn't account for Martian dust accumulation and temperature variations. I did." Alexis pulled up the performance metrics. "We'll need weekly cleaning cycles, but output should remain stable."

"I'll assign a maintenance crew from my team."

Alexis glanced at him. Over the past four months, Reeves had transformed from corporate oversight to genuine partner. He understood Mars now. Understood that survival mattered more than profit margins.

"Thank you," she said.

The comm chimed. Rivera's voice: "All senior staff to the conference room. Immediately."

Alexis and Reeves exchanged glances. Immediate meant crisis.

They found Rivera with a message displayed on the main screen. Corporate letterhead. Formal language. The kind that preceded bad news.

"They're shutting us down," Rivera said without preamble.

Silence. Then Chen spoke. "What?"

"Corporate has reviewed the subsurface findings. They've determined that preserving the alien structures takes priority over colony operations. We have six months to wind down, pack up, and return to Earth."

"That's insane," Alexis said. "We're finally stable. Production is sustainable. We can maintain the colony indefinitely now."

"Corporate doesn't care about sustainability. They care about the technology in those structures." Rivera pulled up another document. "They're planning to sterilize the surface and establish a sealed archaeological site. No permanent human presence. Just robotic systems and occasional research visits."

"They can't do that," Yuki said.

"They can. They own the colony. They own the equipment. They own our contracts." Rivera met each person's eyes. "They're offering generous severance packages. Full pay for the time we've served, bonuses for cooperation, job placement assistance on Earth."

"And if we refuse?" Hassan asked.

"They'll terminate our contracts and strand us here until the evacuation ship arrives. No pay. No bonuses. No future employment with any corporate entity."

Alexis felt fury build in her chest. "We built this place. Bled for it. Nearly died for it. And they're just going to erase it?"

"They're businesspeople," Reeves said quietly. "The structures are worth more than the colony. It's simple economics."

"It's simple betrayal," Chen countered.

Rivera raised a hand. "We have six months to decide our response. I'm not going to force anyone to stay or leave. This decision is personal."

"What will you do?" Yuki asked.

Rivera was quiet for a long moment. Then: "I came to Mars to build something permanent. That hasn't changed. I'm staying."

"They'll arrest you," Hassan said.

"Let them try. By the time Earth's enforcement arrives, we'll have a functioning independent colony. Self-sufficient. No corporate support needed."

"That's rebellion," Reeves said.

"That's survival." Rivera pulled up the colony's resource projections. "Look at these numbers. We're producing enough food, water, and power to sustain two hundred and fifty people indefinitely. We don't need corporate anymore. We never did. We just needed their initial investment."

"They'll send security forces," Alexis said.

"Eventually. But that takes time and money. We'll make it expensive enough that negotiations become cheaper than enforcement."

"You're talking about independence," Hassan said with wonder.

"I'm talking about finishing what we started." Rivera looked at each of them. "Mars doesn't belong to corporate. Doesn't belong to Earth. It belongs to whoever's willing to live here, die here, and build something that lasts. That's us. If we want it."

Alexis thought about the solar arrays. The repaired recyclers. The hydroponics bays producing food. The subsurface structures holding ancient knowledge.

Everything they'd built. Everything they'd sacrificed.

"I'm in," she said.

Chen nodded. "Me too."

Yuki hesitated only a moment. "I didn't come this far to quit now."

Hassan smiled. "Someone needs to study those structures properly. Might as well be us."

Everyone looked at Reeves. He stood silent, clearly conflicted.

"I have a wife on Earth," he said finally. "Kids. Corporate career. Everything I'm supposed to want."

"No one's judging you for leaving," Rivera said gently.

"No. You're judging me for considering it." Reeves sat heavily. "Because you're all willing to risk everything for Mars. And I'm calculating exit strategies."

"You have more to lose," Alexis said.

"Or more reason to stay." Reeves pulled up his own tablet. "My kids are growing up on a dying planet. Overcrowded. Polluted. Fighting over resources. Mars could be different. Could be better."

"It won't be easy," Rivera warned.

"Nothing worthwhile is." Reeves made his decision. "I'm in. But I want my family here. If we're building something permanent, I want them part of it."

"We'll arrange transport," Rivera said. "Anyone else who wants family here, send the requests. We'll coordinate a civilian immigration wave."

The meeting continued for hours. Planning. Logistics. Risk assessment. By evening, they had the framework for Mars's first independent settlement.

They'd need to establish governance. Secure resources. Defend against potential corporate interference. Build relationships with Earth-based supporters.

Impossible. Dangerous. Necessary.

Everything Mars had always been.

Alexis returned to the engineering bay and looked at the power grid. Their power grid now. Not corporate's. Not Earth's.

Mars's.

She pulled up long-term expansion plans. More domes. Additional solar arrays. Expanded hydroponics. Maybe even manufacturing facilities.

A real colony. Not corporate infrastructure. Not temporary outpost.

Home.

Permanent. Sustainable. Independent.

Exactly what they'd come to build.

Rivera's voice came over the comm later that night. Colony-wide announcement.

"This is Commander Rivera. Many of you have heard the news. Corporate wants us to abandon Mars. They're wrong. We've built something here worth keeping. Worth fighting for. I'm asking anyone who agrees to stay. Help me build Mars's first independent colony. Help me prove that humanity's future includes this world. No pressure. No judgment for those who leave. But for those who stay—thank you. Let's make history together."

The response was overwhelming. Of the two hundred and fifteen colonists, one hundred and ninety-three chose to stay.

They'd come to Mars as corporate employees.

They'd stay as pioneers.

Alexis stood at the viewport and watched the sun set over rust-colored plains. Somewhere below, ancient Martians had built a library, hoping future intelligence would read it.

Now that intelligence would also call Mars home.

The builders would have approved.

She was sure of it.
