The reactor spike began at 0600 hours, exactly as planned.

Chen's fingers danced across her console, carefully throttling the antimatter injectors. The containment field wobbled—not enough to risk breach, but enough to look convincing.

"Readings?" she asked.

Her assistant, Junior Engineer Kim, monitored the outputs. "Radiation up thirty percent. EM signature spiking across all bands. It looks like a pre-failure cascade."

"Good." Chen increased the fluctuation. "Let's give it a show."

On the bridge, Elena watched the tactical display. The anomaly had been static for hours. Now, as the reactor's signature changed, it moved.

"Contact is adjusting position," Reyes reported. "Closing distance. Two hundred thousand klicks. One-fifty. One hundred."

"Hold course," Elena said. "Let it come."

Marcus stood at her shoulder. "Captain, if it interprets this as an attack—"

"It won't." Elena kept her voice steady. "It's curious. That's what we're counting on."

The anomaly accelerated. Seventy thousand klicks. Fifty.

"It's scanning us," Patel said from his station. "Multiple frequencies. Concentrated on the engineering section."

"Chen, kill the spike," Elena ordered.

The reactor stabilized instantly. Clean, smooth, professional.

The anomaly stopped.

Thirty thousand klicks. Close enough to see it on visual now—a dark sphere that seemed to absorb light, rimmed with faint energy patterns that shifted like oil on water.

"Captain," Reyes said quietly. "Weapons lock acquired."

"Don't fire."

The bridge was silent except for the soft hum of systems and the quiet breathing of her crew.

The anomaly did nothing. It just hung there, watching.

"Analysis?" Elena asked.

Patel frowned at his data. "It's not hostile. If it wanted to destroy us, it would've done it by now."

"Then what does it want?"

"I don't—" Patel stopped. "Wait. I'm getting a signal."

"On speakers."

Static filled the bridge. Then, slowly, a pattern emerged. Not words. Not language. But something structured. Mathematical. Repeating.

Elena listened to the rhythm. Prime numbers. Basic arithmetic. The universal language of intelligence.

"It's trying to communicate," she said.

"Should we respond?" Marcus asked.

Elena thought of Phobos. Three hundred dead. Her sister's face in the photo. The classified files that someone didn't want anyone to see.

"Yes," she said. "Patel, send the same sequence back. Let's see what happens."

The response was immediate. The anomaly's signal changed, grew more complex. Images started forming in their sensor data—mathematical constructs, geometric patterns, cascading equations.

"It's teaching us," Patel breathed. "Showing us its language."

Elena watched the data flow. Beautiful. Terrifying. Ancient.

"Record everything," she ordered. "And send a priority transmission to Fleet Command. Tell them we've made first contact."

"Captain," Marcus said. "Torres ordered us to stand down."

"Torres isn't here." Elena never took her eyes off the anomaly. "We are."

The signal grew stronger, pulling them deeper into conversation with something that might be older than Earth itself.

And Elena Reeves, who had failed to save Phobos, who carried her dead in the circuits of her arm, decided that some orders were worth breaking.
