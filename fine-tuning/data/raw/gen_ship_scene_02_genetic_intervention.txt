The genetic diversity report landed on Medical Director James Okoye's desk like a death sentence.

Critical threshold in three generations. Population bottleneck inevitable. Genetic disorders increasing.

Two hundred years into the journey. Two hundred years to go.

Not enough diversity to survive that long.

James pulled up the detailed analysis. Fourth-generation crew showed elevated rates of immune system disorders, metabolic irregularities, decreased fertility. All predictable consequences of limited genetic variation.

The frozen embryo banks were supposed to prevent this. Carefully curated genetic diversity, ready for deployment when needed.

Except the cryogenic systems were failing. Slowly. Inevitably.

James activated his comm. "Captain Reyes, I need to brief the council. We have a medical crisis developing."

The council chamber was already tense. Malik Torres's faction pushing for landing on Kepler-442b. Dr. Eva Sato's traditionalists insisting on continuing to Proxima. Now James had to add another crisis to the debate.

"Genetic analysis shows we're approaching critical diversity thresholds," he began, displaying the data. "Fourth-generation crew has higher rates of genetic disorders than predicted. Fifth generation will be worse."

"The embryo banks—" Eva started.

"Are failing. Cryogenic failures are increasing. We've lost twelve percent of the genetic material already." James pulled up the failure projections. "At current rates, we lose another thirty percent before we reach Proxima."

Captain Ana Reyes studied the numbers. "How many healthy embryos do we need to maintain viable diversity?"

"Minimum? About sixty percent of current inventory. We're approaching that threshold now."

The council erupted in discussion. Malik's faction saw vindication—land on Kepler-442b, introduce new environmental pressures, force genetic adaptation. Eva's traditionalists argued for accelerating embryo implantation programs, increasing genetic diversity through planned breeding.

James let them argue for ten minutes before calling for order.

"Both approaches have merit. But there's a third option." He pulled up the medical protocols. "We have the genetic sequencing technology. We can create synthetic diversity. Designer embryos with calculated genetic variation."

"That's eugenics," someone objected.

"That's survival," James countered. "We're not creating superior humans. We're preventing extinction through inbreeding."

"Still playing god with human genetics," Eva said quietly.

"We've been doing that since we selected the embryo bank donors," Malik pointed out. "This is just the next step."

The debate shifted. Ethics versus pragmatism. Natural selection versus artificial intervention. The age-old question of what humans were willing to do to survive.

James watched them argue, knowing the medical reality would force a decision eventually. The numbers didn't care about philosophy.

After three hours, Ana called for a vote.

Authorization to begin genetic intervention program: approved, with conditions.

Medical oversight. Ethical review board. Transparency in selection criteria. No attempts to create "superior" traits—only diversity preservation.

James had his authorization. Now came the hard part: implementing it.

He spent the next week in the genetic lab, reviewing donor profiles and calculating optimal variation. The goal wasn't perfect humans. It was diverse humans. Genetic variation sufficient to prevent bottleneck collapse.

Dr. Yuki Nakamura, the ship's geneticist, worked with him. "We can introduce variation in immune system genes, metabolic pathways, cellular repair mechanisms. Make the population more resilient."

"Without creating identifiable genetic classes," James added. "Everyone needs to be naturally viable. No dependencies on medical intervention."

"Agreed." Yuki pulled up the embryo specifications. "I'm thinking eight new genetic lines. Each with distinct variation in non-critical systems. Phenotypically normal but genetically diverse."

"How long to create them?"

"Synthesis and validation? Four months. Implantation and gestation? Standard nine months." Yuki ran the timeline. "First designer generation births within thirteen months."

James approved the protocols. The work began.

Creating life from genetic code and artificial wombs. Not cloning—true synthesis. New humans with carefully designed variation to save the species.

The ethical weight was crushing.

But the alternative was extinction.

Volunteer mothers came forward for implantation. Women who understood the mission, accepted the responsibility, trusted the medical team.

James briefed each one personally. Explaining the process, the reasoning, the importance.

"Your child will be genetically unique," he told them. "Designed for diversity, not superiority. Fully human, just carefully varied."

Some accepted immediately. Others needed time to process. All eventually agreed.

The mission was bigger than individual comfort.

The first implantations succeeded. Eight embryos, eight mothers, eight chances to expand the genetic pool.

James monitored the pregnancies obsessively. Every health metric, every developmental milestone. The synthetic embryos developed normally. No complications beyond standard pregnancy risks.

At seven months, he presented preliminary results to the council.

"All eight pregnancies progressing normally. Genetic screening shows successful variation integration. If these births succeed, we'll have proven the concept."

"And if they don't?" Eva asked.

"Then we adjust and try again." James pulled up the alternative scenarios. "But failure here doesn't mean failure of the approach. It means we need to refine our methods."

Malik studied the data. "Assuming success, how many synthetic lines do we need for long-term viability?"

"Twenty to thirty distinct lines. Enough variation to prevent bottleneck effects for the remainder of the journey."

"That's a generation of designer children."

"That's a generation of survivors." James met Malik's eyes. "We can debate the ethics after we ensure there's a species to debate them."

The first births came at month thirteen.

Three healthy babies. Standard weight, normal development, no complications. Genetically diverse, phenotypically unremarkable.

Perfect.

The other five births followed over the next two weeks. All healthy. All viable.

Eight new genetic lines successfully introduced to the population.

James held one of the infants—a girl named Sofia, daughter of engineer Chen Mei. She looked absolutely normal. Tiny hands, curious eyes, completely human.

No one would ever know she'd been designed rather than conceived naturally.

That was the point.

"She's beautiful," Chen said, her voice filled with wonder and relief.

"She's hope," James replied. "For all of us."

The genetic intervention program expanded. More synthetic lines, more volunteer mothers, more careful introduction of diversity.

The council's concerns about eugenics faded as the results proved themselves. These weren't superior humans. They were just humans—diverse, viable, healthy.

The population's genetic health metrics began improving. Immune disorders decreased. Metabolic problems stabilized. Fertility rates increased.

The ship could make it to Proxima. Not easily. Not without continued intervention.

But survivably.

James presented his findings to a joint council session.

"Genetic intervention is working. We're maintaining viable diversity. The bottleneck threat is manageable." He pulled up the long-term projections. "We can complete the mission."

"At the cost of natural reproduction," Eva said.

"At the cost of random reproduction," James corrected. "We're still human. Still breeding. Still raising children. We're just being strategic about genetic variation."

"That changes the fundamental nature of the mission," Malik argued. "We're not just transporting Earth humans to Proxima. We're creating a new subspecies adapted for generation ship survival."

"Is that bad?" James challenged. "Humans have always adapted to their environments. We're just accelerating the process."

The debate continued, but the program continued too.

Because survival wasn't optional.

And adaptation was what humanity did best.

Years passed. The synthetic generation children grew. No different from naturally conceived children except in their carefully designed genetic variation.

They played, learned, made friends, fell in love. Completely human in every way that mattered.

The ship sailed on toward Proxima. Carrying its precious cargo of adapted humanity.

And James Okoye, looking at the thriving fourth and fifth generation crew, allowed himself to believe they'd make it.

Not as the humans who'd left Earth.

But as the humans Earth's children had become.

Adapted. Diverse. Resilient.

Ready for whatever Proxima held.
