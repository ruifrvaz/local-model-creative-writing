Station Director Nkrumah found the pattern in the security logs. Subtle. Almost invisible. But present.

Someone was accessing diplomatic communication archives. Not current traffic—historical records from the peace negotiations. Specific sections. Specific conversations.

Always at odd hours. Always from different terminals. Always covering their tracks.

He called Volkov to his office.

"Someone's researching the peace process," he said. "Systematically. Professionally. They're looking for something specific."

Volkov reviewed the access logs. "This is good operational security. They're not leaving obvious trails. But the pattern is there if you know where to look."

"Can you identify them?"

"Give me forty-eight hours."

She worked the problem methodically. Cross-referenced terminal access with personnel schedules. Matched typing patterns through keystroke analysis. Followed digital breadcrumbs through three layers of obfuscation.

The answer was unexpected.

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo. The medical officer who'd treated casualties from the diplomatic bombing. Widely respected. No obvious motive for covert research.

"Why would she be accessing peace negotiation archives?" Nkrumah asked.

"Only one way to find out." Volkov made arrangements. "I'll bring her in for questioning."

Dr. Okonkwo came willingly. Sat across from Volkov and Nkrumah in the interrogation room without apparent nervousness.

"You've been accessing diplomatic archives," Volkov said without preamble. "Why?"

"Research."

"What kind of research requires covert access at 0300?"

Sarah met her eyes steadily. "The kind that examines how peace processes fail. I'm writing a book about conflict resolution in space-based environments."

Nkrumah pulled up her personnel file. No mention of book projects. No publishing history.

"You're a medical doctor, not a political scientist."

"I'm a doctor who treated people wounded by political violence. That gives me perspective worth documenting."

Volkov wasn't convinced. "The specific files you accessed—they all relate to corporate interference in the peace process. Financial trails. Sabotage operations. Classified information."

"Which I have security clearance to access. I'm not stealing anything. I'm reading public record."

"Some of those files are restricted."

"Some are poorly labeled as restricted when they should be public. I'm documenting failures in transparency." Sarah leaned forward. "Is this really about my research? Or about the uncomfortable truths that research might reveal?"

Nkrumah intervened. "Dr. Okonkwo, we're not trying to suppress legitimate research. We're investigating unusual access patterns that match espionage profiles."

"Then investigate. You'll find I'm exactly what I claim—a medical professional documenting the human cost of diplomatic failure."

They released her after two hours. No charges. No restrictions.

But Volkov wasn't satisfied.

"She's hiding something," Volkov told Nkrumah. "The cover story is plausible but too convenient."

"Or she's exactly what she claims and we're being paranoid."

"Paranoia kept this station safe through multiple sabotage attempts. I'm not abandoning it now."

Volkov established discrete surveillance. Monitoring Sarah's communications. Tracking her movements. Looking for connections to external interests.

What she found was unexpected. Sarah was meeting regularly with a journalist. Independent reporter who'd covered the peace negotiations. They exchanged encrypted files. Discussed publication timelines.

Not espionage. Actual research collaboration.

Volkov pulled the journalist's background. Credentials checked out. History of investigative reporting on corporate influence. Recent focus on peace process manipulation.

She reported her findings to Nkrumah.

"Sarah's writing an exposé. With professional journalistic partnership. Looking to publish a comprehensive investigation of corporate sabotage during the peace talks."

"That's going to make powerful people very angry."

"That's why she was being covert. Protecting her sources. Avoiding preemptive legal action." Volkov pulled up draft excerpts Sarah had shared with the journalist. "It's thorough. Names executives. Documents financial flows. Proves systematic sabotage."

Nkrumah read the excerpts. They were damning. Evidence presented clearly. Conclusions supported by documentation. Journalism that would reshape public understanding of the peace process.

"Do we stop her?" he asked.

"On what grounds? She's accessed legal information. Reported accurately. Collaborated with legitimate journalist." Volkov smiled slightly. "She's doing exactly what we hoped the peace process would enable—holding powerful interests accountable."

"Those powerful interests won't appreciate the accountability."

"Then they'll respond. And we'll deal with that response." Nkrumah made the decision. "We don't interfere. Sarah publishes her research. The station remains neutral territory where truth can emerge."

"We might face retaliation. Corporate pressure. Legal threats."

"We've faced worse. And survived." Nkrumah pulled up the station's diplomatic charter. "Neutrality means protecting uncomfortable truths along with comfortable ones."

Volkov notified Sarah that her research had been identified. That station security wouldn't interfere. That she should continue her work with the understanding that powerful interests would oppose publication.

Sarah's response was simple: "I know. I'm doing it anyway."

The exposé published three months later. Major networks picked it up. Corporate media tried suppressing it. Independent outlets amplified it.

The response was exactly as predicted. Legal threats. Character assassination. Attempts to discredit Sarah's credentials and motivations.

But the documentation was too thorough. The evidence too compelling.

Public opinion shifted. The peace process that had seemed politically motivated revealed itself as struggle against corporate profit interests. The sabotage that had killed dozens exposed as calculated manipulation.

Three executives faced criminal charges. Two mega-corporations saw stock prices collapse. The political landscape transformed.

Sarah appeared on the station's public forum to discuss her work. Nkrumah attended. Heard her articulate why medical professionals should document political violence.

"I treated the wounded from bombings and assassinations," she said. "I saw the human cost of corporate profit-seeking. Remaining silent about that cost felt like malpractice. So I documented it. Published it. Made people confront what was done in their names."

"Did you expect this level of impact?" someone asked.

"I hoped for truth. Impact is what others do with that truth." Sarah smiled. "I'm just a doctor who wrote down what she saw."

But she was more than that. Nkrumah understood. She'd become a symbol. Proof that individuals could challenge concentrated power through careful documentation and courageous publication.

The station gained reputation. Place where uncomfortable truths could emerge. Where neutral ground meant more than political maneuvering.

Corporate interests that had tried suppressing Sarah's work found themselves unable to operate on the station. Their representatives were denied docking privileges. Their financial influence rejected.

"We're taking sides," Nkrumah's deputy warned. "Against corporate power."

"We're taking the side of truth. If that appears anti-corporate, that says more about corporations than about us." Nkrumah pulled up the station charter. "Neutrality isn't passivity. It's creating space where facts can exist without political distortion."

The station evolved. Became haven for investigative journalists. Whistleblowers. Researchers documenting uncomfortable realities.

Not always popular. Not always safe.

But necessary.

Sarah continued her medical practice. Also continued documenting. Three more books over the next decade. Each exposing different aspects of power and violence in space-based environments.

She became the station's conscience. Reminder that neutrality meant protecting truth-tellers.

Nkrumah met with her on the tenth anniversary of her first publication.

"You changed this station," he said. "Made us commit to something more than political balance."

"I just told the truth. You protected my ability to tell it." Sarah looked at the station beyond the viewport. "That's what neutrality should mean. Space where truth can exist."

"Even when truth is dangerous?"

"Especially then." Sarah smiled. "Safe truths don't need protecting."

Nkrumah nodded. She was right.

The station had become something unprecedented. Not just neutral territory. Truth territory.

Where facts mattered more than power.

That was worth protecting.

Whatever the cost.
