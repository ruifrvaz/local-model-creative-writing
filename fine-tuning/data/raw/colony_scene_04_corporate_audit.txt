The corporate representative arrived on the monthly supply shuttle, impeccably dressed despite six months in transit. David Chen from Martian Operations Division, here to "evaluate operational efficiency."

Alexis knew what that meant. Auditor. Someone sent to find reasons to cut funding further.

She met him in the arrival bay, watching him struggle with the reduced gravity. He stumbled, caught himself, tried to look dignified. Failed.

"Ms. Kwan?" He extended a hand.

"Engineer Kwan." She shook briefly. "Welcome to Mars. Try not to bounce. Bend your knees more when you walk."

Chen nodded, embarrassed. "Thank you. I'm here to review your operations. Commander Rivera said you'd give me the technical tour?"

"That's what they pay me for." Alexis gestured toward the inner modules. "Watch your head on the doorframes. They're built low to save on pressurized volume."

She led him through the colony, explaining systems with professional detachment. Water recycling. Power generation. Food production. Every word measured, every detail calculated to impress.

Chen took notes on a tablet, asking pointed questions about cost overruns and resource utilization. The kind of questions that came from spreadsheets, not experience.

"Your food production is below projected yields," he said, showing her graphs.

"Because we diverted power during the dust storm. Plants need light." Alexis kept her voice neutral. "We prioritized survival over optimization."

"Still, the numbers—"

"Are alive and breathing." She stopped, forcing him to meet her eyes. "Sixty-three people survived a six-day storm with four days of battery reserves. That's the number that matters."

Chen made another note. Alexis couldn't tell if it was positive or damning.

They reached the excavation site where the new water pumping system was taking shape. Hassan was directing the installation of filtration units while Yuki calibrated flow sensors.

"This is our newest project," Alexis said. "Subsurface water extraction. Reduces our dependency on ice hauling by forty-two percent."

"I read the report. Impressive discovery." Chen studied the equipment. "But the infrastructure costs are significant. Wouldn't it be more efficient to continue ice hauling with autonomous equipment?"

"More efficient until the equipment breaks. Or gets buried in a storm. Or we run out of accessible surface ice." Alexis pulled up geological surveys. "This aquifer is stable, renewable, and under our direct control. That's worth the infrastructure investment."

"Perhaps. But corporate is concerned about your resource utilization patterns. You're consuming materials faster than projected."

"Because we're solving problems that weren't in the projections. Water contamination. Storm damage. Equipment failures." Alexis felt her patience thinning. "Mars doesn't care about your projections."

Chen's expression tightened. "Mars Operations Division has allocated significant resources to this colony. We need to see returns on that investment."

"You want returns? We discovered subsurface water. We documented potential native microbial life. We developed new filtration protocols that could benefit every Mars operation." Alexis gestured at the colony. "What more do you want?"

"Profitability. Sustainability. Evidence that this colony can operate without constant Earth support."

"Then give us the tools to be self-sufficient. Every time we request manufacturing equipment or advanced fabrication systems, corporate says it's too expensive. So we improvise with what we have, which costs more in the long run." Alexis crossed her arms. "You can't demand independence while maintaining dependency."

Chen was quiet for a moment. "You're very direct, Engineer Kwan."

"It's a character flaw. Ask anyone."

"Actually, Commander Rivera said the same thing." Chen smiled slightly. "She also said you're the best structural engineer in the program. That you solve impossible problems."

"I solve the problems Mars gives me. Whether they're impossible doesn't matter."

"Then solve this one." Chen showed her his tablet. "Corporate wants to reduce the colony's operational budget by thirty percent. I'm here to identify which programs to cut."

The number hit like a physical blow. Thirty percent. That wasn't optimization. That was gutting.

"You can't cut thirty percent without losing critical functionality."

"Then help me find twenty. Or fifteen. Show me where we can trim without compromising safety." Chen's expression was earnest. "I'm not the enemy, Engineer Kwan. I'm trying to keep this colony alive within the constraints I've been given."

Alexis wanted to argue. But she recognized sincerity when she heard it. Chen wasn't here to destroy them. He was here to save what he could.

"Give me two days," she said. "I'll run the analysis."

"You have one day. I leave on the return shuttle tomorrow night."

"Then I'll work fast."

Alexis spent the next eighteen hours buried in resource allocation models. Every system, every program, every expenditure examined for potential cuts. The work was brutal—finding places to save money meant finding places where they were spending unnecessarily. And on Mars, nothing was unnecessary.

Rivera joined her at midnight, bringing coffee synthesized from the hydroponics output.

"How bad?" Rivera asked.

"Bad. Best case, I can find twelve percent in efficiency improvements. Reduced power consumption, optimized resource cycling, deferred maintenance on non-critical systems." Alexis showed her the projections. "But that assumes nothing breaks and we don't hit any unexpected problems."

"On Mars."

"Exactly." Alexis took a sip of the coffee. It tasted like dirt, but it was hot. "I can't get to twenty percent without cutting personnel."

"How many?"

"Eight positions. Mostly research roles. Lab techs, geologists, secondary medical staff."

Rivera was quiet. "Hassan?"

"Hassan makes the cut as essential. His geology work is directly tied to resource acquisition. But his two junior researchers don't." Alexis felt sick saying it. "We're talking about sending people back to Earth. Careers ended. Dreams destroyed."

"Versus keeping them here without the resources to sustain them."

"I know. But it still feels like failure." Alexis pulled up personnel files. "These are good people. They came to Mars to do important work."

"And they did. But now we have to make choices." Rivera studied the names. "Who decides?"

"You're the commander. It's your call."

"Then I'm delegating. Give me your recommendation. Who's essential, who's valuable, who can we afford to lose?"

Alexis spent another three hours on the analysis. She tried to be objective, to look at roles and skills rather than faces and personalities. But she knew these people. Had worked alongside them. Celebrated their discoveries. Commiserated over their failures.

Choosing who stayed and who left felt like choosing who mattered.

By dawn, she had a list. Eight names. Eight people whose jobs could be absorbed by others or eliminated entirely without immediate operational impact.

"Here," she told Rivera, handing over the tablet. "This gets us to eighteen percent reduction with eight personnel cuts."

Rivera reviewed the list, her face expressionless. Then she nodded. "I'll inform them before Chen leaves. They deserve to hear it from me."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. You did what needed to be done." Rivera met her eyes. "That's your job, Alexis. Making hard choices. Living with them."

Chen accepted the proposal with professional courtesy. Eighteen percent wasn't thirty, but it was close enough to demonstrate serious cost-cutting efforts.

"This is good work, Engineer Kwan. I'll recommend approval." He paused. "For what it's worth, I understand how difficult this was. I've had to make similar decisions on Earth."

"Did it get easier?"

"No. But you learn to carry it." Chen gathered his materials. "One piece of advice? Don't let the survivors see your guilt. They need to believe you made the right choice. Otherwise, they'll question their own value."

The shuttle departed that evening, carrying eight colonists back to Earth. Alexis watched from the observation dome as the transport climbed through the thin atmosphere, brilliant against the darkening sky.

Hassan stood beside her, silent. His two junior researchers were on that shuttle.

"They were good people," he said finally.

"I know."

"Martinez had a theory about subsurface crystalline formations. Could have been groundbreaking." Hassan's voice was flat. "Now someone else will publish it. Or no one will."

"I'm sorry, Hassan."

"Don't be. You made the call you had to make." He turned from the window. "But don't expect me to like it."

He left. Alexis stayed, watching until the shuttle's engines were just another distant star.

Yuki appeared, carrying two bulbs of the terrible coffee.

"Heard it was rough," Yuki said.

"Yeah."

They drank in silence, the coffee's warmth inadequate against the cold settling in Alexis's chest.

"For what it's worth," Yuki said, "you kept the colony alive. That counts for something."

"Does it? We sent eight people home. Eight dreams ended."

"Fifty-five dreams continue. You weighted the numbers, made the hard call, and now we move forward." Yuki clinked her bulb against Alexis's. "That's engineering. Sometimes the solution sucks, but it's still the right answer."

Alexis managed a weak smile. "When did you become so philosophical?"

"Somewhere between the water contamination and the dust storm. Mars makes you grow up fast." Yuki finished her coffee. "Come on. Rivera's calling an all-hands meeting. We need to reassure everyone that this isn't the beginning of total closure."

The meeting was tense. Rivera explained the budget cuts, the personnel decisions, the path forward. People asked hard questions. Rivera gave honest answers.

At the end, she looked directly at the assembled colonists.

"I won't lie to you. This is difficult. We're being asked to do more with less, to prove our value to people who measure worth in quarterly reports. But here's what I know: this colony survives because of your competence, your dedication, your willingness to solve impossible problems. Eight people are returning to Earth, and that's a loss. But fifty-five remain. And we're going to show corporate exactly what we can accomplish."

Scattered applause. Not enthusiastic, but real.

Alexis watched her commander work the room, offering reassurance and resolve in equal measure. This was leadership—carrying the weight so others didn't have to.

Later, in her quarters, Alexis pulled up personnel files for the eight who'd left. She read their contributions, their accomplishments, their dreams of Mars.

Then she filed the reports and started planning resource allocations for the reduced staff.

Because that was her job. Making hard choices. Living with them.

Carrying the weight.

Mars didn't care about guilt or regret. It cared about capability. About whether you could solve the problem in front of you.

Alexis could. She would.

Even when the solutions hurt.

Even when the numbers added up to loss.

That was engineering. That was Mars.

That was the price of survival.
