Yuki found Martinez in the common area at midnight, staring at his tablet with tears on his face.

She almost walked away. Privacy was rare on Mars. You didn't intrude.

But Martinez looked broken. And broken people made mistakes. Mistakes killed.

"Want to talk?" she asked.

He looked up, tried to wipe his face quickly. Failed. "I'm fine."

"You're not." Yuki sat across from him. "But that's okay. Nobody's fine here."

Martinez set down the tablet. The screen showed a woman holding a child. His wife and daughter, Yuki guessed. Back on Earth.

"She's divorcing me," he said quietly. "Can't handle the separation anymore. Says I chose Mars over family."

"Did you?"

"I don't know. Maybe." Martinez picked up the tablet, set it down again. "I thought this would be temporary. Two years on Mars, then rotation home. Build the colony, return to Earth with experience and money. But two years became three. Three became four. And now she's done waiting."

Yuki had heard this story before. Different people, same ending. Mars had a way of taking everything you brought with you and demanding more.

"I'm sorry," she said.

"Everyone says that. Nobody fixes it." Martinez stood, agitated. "I'm thirty-seven thousand kilometers from home. By the time I get there, she'll have moved on. My daughter won't remember me. Everything I left behind will be gone."

"Not everything. You're building something here."

"Am I?" Martinez gestured at the habitat. "Or am I just maintaining equipment until it kills us? Patching systems that should've been replaced years ago? Pretending we're not slowly dying in a desert nobody wants?"

The bitterness was sharp. Dangerous. Yuki recognized the edge of despair that led to poor judgment.

"You want to quit?" she asked.

"I want to matter. I want my life to mean something beyond keeping air processors functional and water recyclers running."

"That matters plenty. Two hundred people breathe because you keep those systems alive."

"Two hundred people I barely know. While my wife and daughter live their lives without me." Martinez slumped back into his chair. "What am I doing here, Tanaka? What's the point?"

Yuki thought about her own reasons for coming to Mars. The career. The adventure. The chance to be part of something permanent.

She'd left behind parents who didn't understand. Friends who thought she was crazy. A partner who'd given an ultimatum: Earth or us.

She'd chosen Mars. And every day since, she wondered if it was worth it.

"I don't know the point," she admitted. "Maybe there isn't one. Maybe we're just stubborn people doing stubborn things on a planet that doesn't care."

"That's depressing."

"It's honest." Yuki leaned forward. "But here's what I know. Tomorrow, those hydroponics need tending. The oxygen recyclers need monitoring. The water filtration needs checking. And if we don't do it, people die. Maybe that's not profound. Maybe it's not meaningful in some cosmic sense. But it's necessary."

Martinez was quiet for a long moment. "You ever regret coming here?"

"Every day. And every day I choose to stay anyway."

"Why?"

"Because quitting is easy. Anyone can quit. But building something permanent? That's rare. That matters."

"Even if it costs everything?"

"Especially then." Yuki stood. "Get some sleep, Martinez. Things look worse at midnight."

She left him there, hoping her words helped. Doubting they would.

In her own quarters, Yuki pulled up photos from Earth. Her parents, smiling at a family dinner she'd missed. Her brother's wedding where she'd appeared via video link, pixelated and delayed. Her niece, born three weeks ago, who she'd never held.

The cost of Mars was measured in moments. Small things. Birthday parties and anniversaries and quiet evenings that happened without you.

Death by a thousand absences.

Yuki closed the photos and focused on work. The hydroponics expansion proposal needed review. Nutrient levels required daily monitoring. The irrigation system had developed a leak in section four.

Practical problems. Solvable problems. Unlike the ache of missing people who'd moved on without her.

She worked until exhaustion forced sleep. Three hours. Maybe four. Then back to maintaining systems that kept everyone alive.

Purpose through necessity. Meaning through survival.

Not profound. But enough.

It had to be enough.

Because the alternative was giving up. And Yuki had come too far to surrender now.

Mars took everything. But it gave something back. Not happiness. Not comfort. Just the hard-earned satisfaction of doing impossible things.

Worth it?

Ask her tomorrow. After the crops were tended and the systems checked and another day survived.

Maybe then she'd have an answer.

Probably not. But maybe.

That uncertainty was the only honest thing left.

She'd learned to live with it.

Everyone on Mars had.
