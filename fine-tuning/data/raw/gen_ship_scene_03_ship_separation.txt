The vote count was even. One hundred forty for landing on Kepler-442b. One hundred forty for continuing to Proxima Centauri.

Engineer Malik Torres and historian Dr. Eva Sato tied. Everything balanced on a knife's edge.

Captain Ana Reyes stood at the council podium, looking at her divided crew. "We need consensus. Not just majority rule."

"The vote was fair," Eva argued. "We counted properly. The tie means we need a tiebreaker."

"A tiebreaker that decides humanity's future?" Malik countered. "That's too much power for one person."

"Then we revote. Keep voting until we have majority."

"Or we compromise," Ana suggested. "Find a third path everyone can accept."

The council chamber erupted in discussion. Arguments for and against each option. Frustration mounting.

Dr. James Okoye, the medical director, stood. "There's another option. One we haven't seriously considered."

"What option?" Ana asked.

"We split up."

Silence. Absolute silence as the implications settled.

"You're proposing we divide the ship?" Eva said slowly.

"I'm proposing we recognize that we have fundamentally different visions for humanity's future." James pulled up engineering schematics. "This ship was designed modular. We could theoretically separate into two vessels."

Malik pulled up the structural analysis. "Technically possible. The colony modules are self-contained. We'd need to build additional propulsion and life support, but..." He ran calculations. "Actually, this could work."

"That's insane," someone objected. "We're one community. One mission."

"We're one community with two incompatible goals," James countered. "Half of us want to land on Kepler-442b. Half want to continue to Proxima. Why should either side surrender their dream?"

Ana studied the proposal. "How would we divide?"

"By choice. Everyone selects their destination. We split resources proportionally, divide crew expertise, ensure both vessels are viable." James pulled up the logistics. "It's not easy. But it's possible."

The debate raged for hours. Ethics of division. Practicality of separation. Emotional impact of fragmenting the community.

Finally, Ana called for another vote.

"Resolution: We explore the possibility of ship separation. Engineering assessment, resource analysis, viability study. No commitment to actually split, just investigating the option."

The vote passed: 214 for, 66 against.

Malik assembled an engineering team. Assessing structural separation points, propulsion requirements, life support duplication. Turning theory into practical reality.

The ship was designed around a central spine with modular habitats branching off. The forward section could theoretically separate, carrying half the population. The aft section would retain primary propulsion and resources.

"We'd need to build a secondary drive system," Malik reported to the council. "Fabricate additional life support, duplicate critical systems. Timeline: eighteen months minimum."

"Resources?" Ana asked.

"We have enough material in the fabrication stores. But it means halting other construction projects." Malik pulled up the trade-offs. "We can do this, but it costs us research capacity, habitat expansion, backup systems."

"Worth it if it resolves the deadlock," James said.

The crew began organizing around the split. Those wanting to land on Kepler-442b joined the "Settlement" faction. Those continuing to Proxima joined the "Mission" faction.

Friendships strained. Families divided. The social fabric tearing along ideological lines.

Malik found himself arguing with his daughter Amara.

"You're really going to keep flying toward Proxima?" she asked. "After everything? After genetic intervention, equipment failures, two hundred years of struggle?"

"The mission is important," Malik said. "We committed to it. I'm seeing it through."

"The mission was our ancestors' choice. Not ours." Amara pulled up Kepler-442b imagery. "I want to walk on a planet, Dad. Feel real gravity. See an actual sky."

"You'll age and die before reaching Proxima if you land. Your children will never see Earth's destination."

"Better a life on one world than a life in transit to another." Amara met his eyes. "I'm joining Settlement. I'm landing."

Malik felt his heart break. "You're leaving the ship?"

"I'm choosing my future. That's what you taught me—make informed decisions, live with consequences." Amara touched his arm. "Don't hate me for following your advice."

He couldn't hate her. But he could grieve.

The construction progressed. New propulsion systems fabricated. Life support duplicated. Critical systems split between vessels.

Eighteen months of intensive engineering. The crew working together to enable their separation.

The division wasn't clean. Spouses choosing different destinations. Siblings separating. Best friends going opposite directions.

Dr. Eva Sato chose Mission, staying true to the original purpose. Dr. James Okoye chose Settlement, prioritizing genetic diversity over historical commitment.

Captain Ana Reyes faced the hardest choice. She'd commanded the unified ship for decades. Now she had to choose which fragment to lead.

She chose Mission. Completing the journey to Proxima. Honoring the commitment.

A younger officer, Commander Kenji Tanaka, agreed to captain Settlement. Leading the landing on Kepler-442b.

The final separation was scheduled for day 642 of preparation. Everything checked. Both vessels viable. Resources divided fairly.

The ship gathered for one last unified assembly. Two hundred eighty people who'd lived together for generations, about to become two separate communities.

Ana addressed them from the podium. "Two hundred years ago, our ancestors left Earth together. One ship, one mission, one purpose. We're changing that today. Not because we've failed, but because we've grown. We've become two communities with different dreams."

She paused, emotion thick in her voice. "Settlement will land on Kepler-442b. Build a colony. Adapt to planetary life. Create a new branch of humanity. Mission will continue to Proxima Centauri. Complete the original journey. Honor our ancestors' vision. Both paths are valid. Both deserve support."

Eva Sato stepped forward. "I disagree with Settlement's choice. But I respect their right to make it. We're not enemies. We're family taking different paths."

Kenji Tanaka nodded. "Mission carries our history. Our purpose. Our connection to Earth. We carry our future. Our adaptation. Our evolution. Both matter."

The assembly ended. People saying goodbye. Promising to stay in contact, knowing communication would be difficult across light-years.

Malik hugged Amara. "Be safe. Build something amazing."

"Complete the mission. Make it to Proxima." She smiled through tears. "Maybe we'll see each other again somehow."

"In another life," Malik agreed.

The separation was mechanical. Explosive bolts. Structural disconnection. Two vessels where there had been one.

Settlement angled toward Kepler-442b. One hundred forty souls. Dreams of planetary life. Determination to thrive.

Mission continued toward Proxima. One hundred forty souls. Commitment to the original purpose. Stubbornness to finish what their ancestors started.

Ana watched Settlement grow smaller on her viewscreen. "Godspeed, Commander Tanaka."

"Godspeed, Captain Reyes," came the reply across the communication link. "May we both find what we're looking for."

The vessels diverged. Different trajectories. Different destinations. Different futures.

But both carrying humanity forward.

Both adapting. Both surviving.

Both proving that humans could thrive anywhere, as long as they chose their own path.

Mission sailed toward Proxima. Lighter. Focused. Committed.

The journey would take another two hundred years.

But they'd see it through.

For the ancestors who started it.

For the descendants who'd complete it.

For the simple human need to finish what they'd begun.

The stars waited.

And Mission continued toward them.

Persistent. Determined. Unbroken.
