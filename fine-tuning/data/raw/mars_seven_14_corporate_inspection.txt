Commander Rivera sat in her office at 0300, staring at the message from Earth Corporation that had arrived six hours ago.

They were sending an inspector.

Not a routine audit. Not a scheduled review. An inspector. Someone to evaluate "operational efficiency and leadership competence" in light of "concerning reports about unauthorized activities."

Translation: someone was coming to fire her.

Rivera had known this was coming. Ever since Hassan's paper went public, ever since the budget battles, ever since every decision she'd made to prioritize crew safety over corporate profit margins.

The question was whether she'd still be in command when humanity's first alien contact team arrived, or whether she'd be on a shuttle home while someone else took credit for her work.

A knock on her door.

"Come in."

Alexis entered, looking as tired as Rivera felt. "You saw the message."

"Hard to miss." Rivera gestured to a chair. "Corporate doesn't exactly hide its intentions."

"What are you going to do?"

"My job. Keep the colony running, keep the crew safe, and let corporate send whoever they want." Rivera pulled up the inspector's profile. "Marcus Chen, senior operations analyst. Twenty years with Earth Corporation. Reputation for 'optimizing underperforming assets.'"

"He's a hatchet man."

"He's corporate's solution to the problem I've become." Rivera closed the file. "How's the crew taking it?"

"About how you'd expect. Pissed off, worried, talking about writing letters of protest." Alexis leaned forward. "Ana, we're not going to let them remove you without a fight."

"I appreciate that. But fighting corporate isn't going to help." Rivera stood and moved to the window. "They have the authority to replace me. Fighting that just makes everyone look bad."

"So you're just going to accept it?"

"I'm going to make sure the colony is in perfect shape when Chen arrives. Give him nothing to criticize. Show him that every controversial decision I've made was the right call." Rivera turned back. "And then I'm going to trust that the crew's results speak louder than corporate's politics."

Alexis was quiet for a moment. "You really think that will work?"

"Probably not. But it's the only option I have that doesn't involve burning bridges I might need later."

Over the next three weeks, Rivera drove the crew harder than she'd driven them in years. Every system optimized. Every report polished. Every procedure documented to corporate standards.

If Chen wanted to find problems, he'd have to work for them.

The inspection shuttle arrived on schedule. Rivera watched it land from the command center, forcing herself to breathe normally.

Marcus Chen emerged in a crisp corporate uniform, tablet already in hand. He was younger than his profile photo—early forties, perhaps. Sharp eyes that missed nothing.

Rivera met him at the airlock.

"Commander Rivera. Welcome to Mars Colony Seven."

"Mr. Chen. Thank you for making the trip." Rivera kept her voice neutral. Professional.

"Let's skip the pleasantries." Chen pulled up a file on his tablet. "I'm here to determine whether this colony is being managed effectively or whether leadership changes are necessary. I'll be conducting interviews with crew members, reviewing operational records, and assessing system performance. I expect full cooperation."

"Of course. I've prepared complete documentation of all major decisions from the past six months."

"I'll review it. Now, show me your operations."

The inspection lasted three days. Chen examined everything—power systems, life support, agricultural outputs, maintenance logs. He interviewed crew members in private, asking pointed questions about leadership and decision-making.

Rivera watched her command dissected with clinical precision.

On day four, Chen requested a private meeting.

Rivera entered the conference room to find him surrounded by data displays. Every controversial decision she'd made, laid out like evidence.

"Let's discuss your operational choices," Chen began. "Starting with the water reclamation failure. You authorized tapping emergency reserves without corporate approval."

"Because waiting for approval would have meant rationing water to four hundred people. I made the call that saved lives."

"You violated protocol."

"I prioritized crew safety over corporate procedure. Which is my job."

Chen made a note. "The alien structure. You delayed reporting for seventy-two hours while you prepared a public data release."

"I wanted to ensure the information was accurate and complete before making extraordinary claims."

"You wanted to prevent corporate from controlling the discovery."

"Both can be true." Rivera met his eyes. "The structure is the biggest discovery in human history. It needed to be handled carefully."

"By going public before corporate could assess the implications."

"By ensuring the scientific community had access to the data. Which is what scientists do."

Chen moved to the next item. "Budget reallocation. You've consistently overspent in engineering and life support while cutting research and development."

"Because engineering and life support keep people alive. R&D can wait. Dead scientists can't."

"Corporate sends you a budget. You're expected to work within it."

"Corporate sends me an inadequate budget and expects miracles. I've delivered those miracles. The colony is functional, growing, and safer than it's ever been." Rivera pulled up performance metrics. "Productivity is up thirty percent. System failures are down forty percent. Crew satisfaction is at an all-time high. Those are results, Mr. Chen. You can argue with my methods, but you can't argue with outcomes."

Chen reviewed the data. His expression was unreadable.

"You're very good at your job, Commander."

"I know."

"You're also insubordinate, difficult to manage, and consistently prioritize your own judgment over corporate directives."

"When corporate directives would get people killed, yes. I do."

Chen set down his tablet. "Here's my assessment. You've built a well-run operation through a combination of competence, stubbornness, and willingness to ignore rules that get in your way. Corporate doesn't like that. They prefer managers who follow procedures."

"Then corporate should send someone else to run a colony on a planet that doesn't follow procedures."

Chen almost smiled. Almost. "My recommendation will be that you remain in command. With conditions."

Rivera felt something loosen in her chest. "What conditions?"

"Monthly reporting directly to me. Advance notification of any decisions that deviate from standard protocol. And most importantly—" Chen pulled up a new file. "You accept a promotion to Regional Director for Mars Operations. Which means you'll be responsible not just for Colony Seven, but for coordinating all Martian installations."

Rivera stared at him. "You're promoting me?"

"Corporate wants someone who knows how to make Mars work. That's you. The alternative is cycling through managers who follow procedures and get people killed." Chen stood. "You've proven that Mars requires a different approach. Corporate is willing to accept that. As long as you keep them informed."

"This is a control mechanism. You're giving me authority so you can monitor me more closely."

"Yes. But it's also recognition that you're the best person for the job." Chen extended his hand. "Do we have an agreement?"

Rivera shook it. "We do. But I'm not going to become a corporate yes-woman."

"I don't expect you to. I expect you to keep doing what you're doing—just with better communication." Chen collected his materials. "I'll be recommending increased funding for life support expansion and agricultural development. Your hydroponics proposal is solid. Corporate will approve it."

After he left, Rivera sat alone in the conference room and tried to process what had just happened.

She'd expected to be fired. Instead, she'd been promoted.

Corporate politics. She'd never understand them.

But she'd won. The colony would get the resources it needed. Her crew would be safer. And she'd maintain enough autonomy to keep making the decisions that mattered.

Rivera pulled up the crew roster and began composing a message. They deserved to know their commander wasn't being replaced.

They deserved to know they'd won this round.

Mars didn't care about corporate politics or inspections or authority structures.

But the people here did. And Rivera had just secured their future for a little while longer.

She'd take that victory and run with it.

Tomorrow, there'd be new crises. New challenges. New impossible choices.

But tonight, she'd celebrate surviving the inspection.

And maybe, just maybe, allow herself to hope that things were getting better.

Small victories.

They were all you got on Mars.

But sometimes, they were enough.
