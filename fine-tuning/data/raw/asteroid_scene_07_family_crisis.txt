The family transmission came through while the Lucky Strike was deep in a mining operation. Kayla Okonkwo listened to her mother's voice, recorded three weeks ago and transmitted across millions of kilometers.

"Your father's sick. Cancer. They caught it late. Treatment is expensive. We're looking at two hundred thousand credits for the full protocol."

Kayla felt the world tilt. Two hundred thousand credits. More than the Lucky Strike earned in a good year.

"We know you're doing important work out there. Don't worry about us. We'll figure something out."

Don't worry. Like that was possible.

She pulled up her personal finances. Fifteen thousand credits saved. Barely a down payment on the treatment her father needed.

Captain Jax found her staring at the financial display. "Bad news?"

"My father. Cancer. Needs treatment we can't afford."

"How much?"

"Two hundred thousand."

Jax winced. "That's brutal. What are your options?"

"I could take a corporate job. Helios is always recruiting experienced pilots. Sign a five-year contract, they'd advance the medical costs."

"You'd hate every minute of it."

"But my father would live."

Jax sat down across from her. "There might be another way. We have the exotic matter. Could sell a portion, get you the money."

"That's the crew's future. Can't ask you to sacrifice it for my family."

"You're not asking. I'm offering."

Kayla felt tears on her face. "You'd really do that?"

"We're crew. That means we look out for each other."

Before she could respond, Wrench joined them. "Overheard the conversation. I vote yes on selling exotic matter for Kayla's father. Family comes first."

Sofia appeared moments later. "Unanimous. We sell what we need to, get your father treatment."

Kayla wanted to argue, to say they shouldn't sacrifice the exotic matter for her. But the relief was overwhelming. Her father could live. That was worth everything.

"How do we sell that much without attracting attention?" she asked.

Jax pulled up Marcus Osei's contact information. "We go back to Freeport. Use our network. Sell in chunks to different buyers. Less profit than bulk sale, but safer."

They diverted to Freeport Three, arriving four days later. Osei listened to their need and didn't hesitate.

"Medical emergency. Understood. I can move exotic matter quickly if you're willing to accept below-market rates."

"How far below?"

"Maybe seventy percent of full value. But I can have credits transferred within forty-eight hours. No questions, no corporate surveillance."

Kayla ran the numbers. Seventy percent of market value for the amount of exotic matter needed meant selling about forty percent of their total supply.

It hurt. But her father's life was worth it.

"Do it."

Osei made calls. Within hours, buyers were arranged. Small transactions scattered across multiple parties, each purchasing amounts too small to trigger corporate interest.

While the sales processed, Kayla sent a message home. "Medical costs covered. Treatment starts immediately. I'll be there as soon as contracts allow."

Her mother's response came back twenty hours later, relief and gratitude overwhelming the words.

The crew didn't talk about the sacrifice. Didn't make Kayla feel like she owed them. Just went back to work like selling forty percent of their exotic matter supply for one crew member's family was completely normal.

Maybe for them it was.

Sofia pulled Kayla aside during the wait. "You know we'd do this for any of us, right? This isn't special treatment. This is how we work."

"I know. Doesn't make it easier to accept."

"Shouldn't be easy. If it was easy, it wouldn't mean anything."

After the sales completed and the credits transferred to her family's account, Kayla stood in the Lucky Strike's observation port, watching Freeport Three rotate slowly against the stars.

The Belt was hard. Survival was brutal. Corporate systems crushed independents through systematic advantage.

But humanity persisted. Through cooperation, through solidarity, through choosing to value people over profit.

That was worth fighting for.

Worth the sacrifices.

Worth everything they'd given up and everything they still risked.

Jax joined her at the viewport. "Your father starts treatment tomorrow. Doctors are optimistic."

"Because of you. Because of this crew."

"Because of us. All of us. Including you."

"I owe you—"

"You owe us continued excellent piloting and the same support when one of us needs it. That's the deal."

Kayla understood. This wasn't charity. This was community. This was what it meant to be crew rather than just coworkers.

They'd sacrificed their exotic matter supply. Reduced their strategic advantage. Set back their plans for months.

And they'd do it again without hesitation.

Because that was the difference between them and the consortiums.

Corporations calculated value in credits and quarterly returns.

Independents calculated value in lives and relationships and the knowledge that you looked out for your own.

The math didn't always favor that approach.

But the humans did.

And in the end, that was what mattered.

Not profit. Not advantage. Not strategic position.

People. Crew. Family.

The things worth sacrificing for.

The things worth fighting for.

The things that made survival in the Belt mean something beyond just not dying.

Kayla pulled up her piloting station and plotted their next course.

Back to the Belt. Back to mining. Back to the endless work of survival.

But with her father in treatment.

With her crew intact.

With the knowledge that humanity could still choose solidarity over self-interest.

Even when the math said it cost too much.

Especially then.

That was when it mattered most.
