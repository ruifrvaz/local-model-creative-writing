The cell sample divided under magnification. Dr. Aisha Mbara watched neural tissue replicate and felt increasingly uneasy about what she was seeing.

"These are from Lieutenant Chen?"

Her research assistant, Dr. Emma Torres, nodded. "Taken during routine biopsy six weeks post-jump seven. They're behaving abnormally."

"Define abnormal."

"They're dividing at rates inconsistent with adult neural tissue. Showing stem cell characteristics that shouldn't exist in mature neurons. And look at the temporal markers."

Emma pulled up the molecular analysis. The cells showed isotopic signatures suggesting they'd existed for different durations. Some cells appeared hours old. Others showed aging consistent with months.

From the same sample. Taken at the same time.

"Temporal desynchronization at the cellular level," Aisha said. "Sarah's entire biology is experiencing time non-linearly now."

"Not just experiencing. Living. Her cells are aging at different rates. Some faster, some slower. It's like her body exists across multiple temporal streams simultaneously."

Aisha ran projections. "If cellular aging is desynchronized, what does that mean for her lifespan?"

"Unknown. Some cells might age rapidly and die. Others might age slowly and persist. She could experience accelerated aging in some tissues while others remain young." Emma highlighted the neural cells. "But her brain cells are stable. The temporal processing centers seem to maintain coherent aging patterns."

"Because they're adapted to temporal variance. Her other tissues aren't."

The implications were staggering. Sarah's consciousness existed across all moments simultaneously. Now her body was following the same pattern. Parts of her in different temporal states, all occupying the same physical space.

"We need to tell her."

"Tell her what? That her body is becoming as temporally fragmented as her mind? She already knows. She exists across all moments. She's aware of her cells aging differently."

"Does she know it's accelerating?"

Emma pulled up the progression charts. "First biopsy showed minimal cellular desynchronization. Second biopsy, moderate. This third biopsy shows severe temporal variance. In six weeks, her cellular biology has fragmented across a temporal range of months."

"How long before that becomes critical?"

"Depends on which tissues desynchronize. If it's non-essential cells, she might live normally. If it's cardiac tissue or neural support structures, she could experience catastrophic organ failure."

Aisha pulled up Sarah's latest medical scans. Overall physiology appeared normal. But the cellular data told a different story. A body slowly fracturing across multiple timelines.

"What caused the acceleration?"

"Best guess? The micro-Alcubierre field generator. It's sustaining her neural temporal processing but also exposing her entire body to exotic physics. The field is making her biology adapt to temporal variance."

"So the device keeping her conscious is also fragmenting her body."

"That's the hypothesis. We'd need to test it. Shut down the micro-field temporarily and see if cellular desynchronization stabilizes."

"Shutting down the field means Sarah loses neural support. Her consciousness could collapse completely."

"So we're trapped. Keep the field active and watch her body fragment across time. Shut it down and lose her consciousness."

Aisha stared at the cell samples. Divided, multiplying, aging at different rates. A biological impossibility made real by exotic physics and human ambition.

"There might be another option. If we can shield her body while maintaining field exposure to her brain, we could prevent cellular fragmentation while sustaining neural function."

Emma pulled up design specs. "That would require precision field control at microscopic scales. The generator would need to create differential field exposure—high intensity for neural tissue, minimal for everything else."

"Can we build that?"

"Kenji could. But it would take weeks. Maybe months."

"We don't have months. The cellular fragmentation is accelerating."

They worked through the night, designing temporal field containment systems. Emma modeled cellular responses to variable field exposure. Aisha calculated safe exposure thresholds.

By morning, they had theoretical specifications for a selective temporal field generator. It might work. Might prevent Sarah's body from fragmenting while sustaining her consciousness.

Might kill her if the field parameters were wrong.

Aisha found Kenji in the FTL lab, working on neural shielding for the next round of test jumps.

"I need you to build something that's never been built before."

"That's literally my job description."

She showed him the specifications. He studied them for three minutes without speaking.

"This is insanely complex. Differential field exposure with micron-scale precision. Real-time adaptive control based on cellular response. I'd need to monitor every cell in Sarah's body simultaneously."

"Can you do it?"

"Theoretically. But one miscalculation and we either fry her cells with excessive field exposure or starve her neurons of temporal energy. The margins are terrifying."

"The alternative is watching her body fragment across multiple timelines until critical organ failure."

Kenji pulled up fabrication resources. "I'll need four weeks. Maybe six."

"You have three."

"Aisha—"

"Her cardiac tissue is showing temporal variance. If that accelerates, she could have a heart attack where different parts of her heart exist in different moments. Three weeks, Kenji. After that, we're into catastrophic failure territory."

He nodded slowly. "I'll build it. But I can't guarantee it works."

"Nobody's guaranteeing anything anymore. We're improvising at the edge of physics."

Sarah arrived that afternoon for her weekly medical assessment. She moved with the portable micro-field generator humming on her back, experiencing reality across multiple temporal states simultaneously.

"I know about the cellular fragmentation," she said before Aisha could speak. "I can feel it. My body existing in different moments. Heart beating in three different rhythms simultaneously."

"Why didn't you report it?"

"Because you'd worry. Try to fix it. Waste resources on me instead of the mission." Sarah sat on the examination table. "I volunteered knowing the cost. The cost increased. I'm still willing to pay it."

"Even if it kills you?"

"I'm going to die. Soon, in subjective experience. Forty-seven years from now, probably. But I experience both moments equally. Death is already here and far away and approaching. All simultaneously."

Aisha felt her medical training clash with philosophical confusion. "That's not how humans process mortality."

"I'm not human anymore. Not entirely. I'm something that exists across temporal states. A consciousness that perceives all moments equally. My body is adapting to match my awareness."

"Your body is fragmenting. Different cells aging at different rates. That's not adaptation, it's breakdown."

"Same thing from different perspectives." Sarah closed her eyes. "But I understand you're trying to help. Building a selective field generator to shield my body while sustaining my neural processing. Kenji started fabrication this morning. I felt it in my future moments."

"You perceive future events?"

"I perceive probability waves. Most likely futures. Kenji builds the generator in three weeks. It works. Mostly. My cellular fragmentation stabilizes. Mostly. I continue existing across all moments but my body stays coherent enough to function."

"And the low-probability futures?"

"Generator fails. My body fragments completely. Catastrophic organ failure across multiple temporal states. Death comes from all directions simultaneously." Sarah opened her eyes. "But that's low probability. Maybe twenty percent. I'll take those odds."

Aisha ran the medical assessment. Cardiovascular function normal, despite cellular temporal variance. Neural activity stable with micro-field support. Overall physiology holding together through physics that shouldn't work.

"You're medically impossible."

"I'm medically revolutionary. First human to exist across multiple temporal states. First consciousness to perceive all moments simultaneously. First person to live beyond linear causality." Sarah smiled. It flickered across different expressions—joy, sadness, resignation, hope. "I'm the prototype for humanity's future. If we're going to travel faster than light regularly, everyone will need to adapt like I did."

"Not everyone survives the adaptation."

"Not everyone survives anything. But the ones who do push humanity forward."

The assessment completed. Sarah left, the micro-field generator humming its strange song of bent spacetime and sustained consciousness.

Aisha returned to the lab and helped Emma refine the cellular models. Three weeks to build a device that had never existed. Three weeks to save someone who existed across all time simultaneously.

Three weeks to prove that humanity could adapt to faster-than-light travel without losing humanity itself.

The cells continued dividing. Aging. Existing in multiple temporal states.

And somewhere in the facility, Kenji built impossible devices from exotic physics and desperate hope.

The future was uncertain.

But Sarah had already experienced it.

And she was willing to bet she'd survive.

Mostly.
