The mining drone returned damaged. Wrench pulled it into the repair bay and started the diagnostic.

"Something hit it," he reported. "Armor scoring consistent with debris impact. But the trajectory doesn't match natural asteroid movement."

Torres joined him at the workbench. "You're saying someone shot at our drone?"

"Or threw something at it. The impact pattern shows intentional aim." Wrench displayed the damage analysis. "This wasn't random collision. Someone attacked our equipment."

Kayla pulled up drone telemetry. "Last position was in sector ninety-three. Claims territory we filed two months ago."

"Who else operates in that sector?"

"Nobody on record. But that doesn't mean nobody's there." Kayla enhanced the drone's last visual scan. "Look at this."

The image showed another ship. Small. Unmarked. Deliberately positioned near their claimed asteroid.

Claim jumpers.

Torres felt anger rise. They'd filed proper claims. Paid the fees. Done everything legally. And someone was muscling in.

"Options?" he asked.

"Confront them directly. Or report to claim enforcement authorities and wait six months for resolution." Wrench didn't look optimistic about either choice.

"If we wait, they strip the claim clean. If we confront, we might start a shooting war."

"Third option," Sofia suggested. "We gather evidence. Document the claim jumping. Then we have legal leverage."

"Evidence gathering requires getting close. Which puts us at risk." Torres studied the sensor data. "But it's better than starting hostilities."

They approached sector ninety-three carefully. Running silent. Passive sensors only. Looking for the claim jumpers without announcing their presence.

The unmarked ship was still there. Actively mining their claimed asteroid.

"That's brazen," Kayla said. "Not even trying to hide."

Torres recorded everything. Ship specifications. Mining operations. Extracted ore composition. Evidence for the claim authorities.

Then the other ship pinged them. Active sensor lock. They'd been detected.

"Rock Hopper, this is independent operator Shrike. You're in our operating zone. Clear out."

Torres opened the channel. "This is my claimed territory. You're the ones operating illegally."

"We surveyed this rock three years ago. Your claim is invalid. Prior occupation takes precedence."

"Prior survey doesn't equal prior claim. We filed proper documentation."

"Your documentation is irrelevant. We're extracting the ore. You can dispute it through legal channels after we're done."

Torres killed the comm. "They're not backing down."

"Neither are we, right?" Wrench looked ready for a fight.

"Wrong. We're outgunned and they know it." Torres pulled up tactical analysis. "The Shrike has military-grade weapons. We start shooting, we lose."

"So we just let them steal our claim?"

"We collect evidence and fight through proper channels." Torres hated the words even as he said them. But survival meant choosing battles carefully.

They maintained position at safe distance. Documenting. Recording. Building an evidence package.

The Shrike worked the asteroid for three days. Stripped it of valuable ore. Then departed without communication.

Torres filed the claim dispute immediately. Full documentation. Visual evidence. Proof of illegal extraction.

The claim authority response came back six weeks later. Case dismissed. Prior occupation rule favored the Shrike. Torres's claim was void.

"That's corruption," Sofia said, reading the decision. "They ignored our evidence."

"They applied the rule that favored the bigger operator." Torres pulled up the Shrike's registration. "This ship is owned by Consolidated Minerals. The same corporation that controls half the claim authorities."

"So we can't win through legal channels."

"Not when the law is written by the people we're fighting against."

Wrench slammed his hand on the console. "Then what? We just accept that corporations can steal our claims?"

"We adapt. Work areas they don't want. Fly beneath their attention." Torres pulled up belt maps. "There's plenty of territory. We avoid the corporate hunting grounds."

"That's surrender."

"That's survival. There's a difference."

But Torres felt the defeat. They'd done everything right. Filed proper claims. Worked legally. And still lost because corporations controlled the system.

The next claim was in fringe territory. Low-yield minerals. Not worth corporate attention.

They worked it carefully. Six weeks of mining for modest profits. Enough to cover expenses. Not enough to thrive.

This was independent mining now. Scraping by in the margins.

"We used to find element 126," Kayla said one evening. "Now we're extracting silicates."

"We used to take risks that almost got us killed," Torres countered. "Now we're surviving. Pick your priorities."

"I pick thriving over surviving."

"Then you pick conflict with entities that have more resources and fewer scruples. That math doesn't work."

Kayla left without answering. Torres knew he'd lost something. The crew's faith that their work mattered. That they could succeed through determination and skill.

Reality was teaching different lessons. Success required either overwhelming power or strategic invisibility. They had neither.

Sofia found Torres in the observation deck that night.

"The crew's discouraged," she said.

"I noticed."

"What happened to the captain who accepted an alien invitation to travel three light-years?"

Torres smiled despite himself. "That was before we realized the humans were more dangerous than the unknown."

"We're still planning that journey. Three years of preparation. Building supplies. Modifying systems." Sofia pulled up their progress logs. "You haven't abandoned it."

"Because it's something corporations can't steal. Can't regulate. Can't control." Torres gestured at the belt. "Out here, we're small fish dodging sharks. But three light-years away? That's territory no one owns yet."

"Think the crew will hold together that long?"

"If I give them something worth holding together for." Torres made a decision. "Call a meeting. I want everyone to hear the plan."

The crew gathered in the common area. Torres laid it out directly.

"The belt is corporate territory. We're never going to thrive here. Too many established interests. Too much competition for resources." He pulled up the alien rendezvous coordinates. "But we've got an invitation to something unprecedented. First contact with non-human intelligence. That's not about mining rights or claim disputes. That's about expansion beyond what humanity's achieved."

"Three light-year journey takes decades," Wrench said. "We're not equipped."

"We're not equipped yet. But we can be. Three years of preparation. Stockpile supplies. Modify the drive for long-range efficiency. Train for extended isolation." Torres met each crew member's eyes. "This is a one-way trip. We commit to reaching that rendezvous or dying in the attempt."

"That's insane," Kayla said. But she smiled when she said it.

"Completely. But it's our insanity. Not corporate-dictated. Not stolen by claim jumpers. Ours." Torres pulled up the preparation checklist. "Who's in?"

Wrench raised his hand first. "Hell yes. I didn't come to space to mine rocks. I came to see what's out there."

Sofia nodded. "For science. And because anything's better than watching corporations carve up the belt."

Kayla took longer. "If we do this, we can't turn back. Can't change our minds halfway."

"Correct. Once we leave, we're committed."

"Then I'm in. Because I'd rather die reaching for something impossible than live settling for scraps."

Torres felt something unlock in his chest. Purpose. Direction. The thing he'd been missing since claim authorities dismissed their case.

"Then we start preparing. Three years. We make the Rock Hopper capable of crossing three light-years." Torres pulled up the modification plans. "And we prove that independent operators can achieve things corporations can't imagine."

The work began immediately. System modifications. Supply stockpiling. Training for extended voyage.

The belt claims became secondary. Just a way to fund the real mission.

Corporations could have the asteroids. Torres and his crew were aiming higher.

Three light-years higher.

Into the unknown.

Where the future waited.
