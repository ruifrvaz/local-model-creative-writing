Marcus sat alone in his quarters, staring at the official response from Fleet Command. The second survey team had reached Kepler-442d. Their preliminary findings matched his team's conclusions almost exactly.

Neurotoxic compounds confirmed. Biochemical incompatibility verified. Dual biospheres documented.

But the recommendation differed.

"Proceed with limited colonization in high-altitude zones. Establish research station with expanded capability for habitat construction. Monitor long-term atmospheric stability."

Marcus felt cold spreading through his chest. They were ignoring the warnings. Prioritizing colonization over safety.

He pulled up the second team's full report. Dr. Sarah Chen had documented the same silicon-carbon compounds. The same neurotoxin exposure risks. The same contamination concerns.

But her conclusions section read differently.

"Risks are manageable with appropriate technology. High-altitude zones provide reduced exposure to silicon photosynthesizers. Atmospheric processing systems can be engineered to filter neurotoxic compounds. Long-term colonization is feasible with proper infrastructure investment."

Feasible. Not safe. Not recommended. Just feasible.

Marcus pulled up the communications appended to the report. Corporate engineering firms providing cost estimates for atmospheric processing systems. Medical consultants suggesting neurotoxin exposure could be managed with preventive medication. Resource economists calculating that Kepler-442d's mineral wealth justified the infrastructure investment.

They'd turned his scientific assessment into a cost-benefit analysis.

And decided the benefits outweighed the risks.

Marcus activated encrypted communication to Dr. Chen on the surface. "Sarah, this is Marcus Osei. I read your report. We need to talk."

The response came six hours later, delayed by distance. "Marcus, I know you have concerns. But the data supports limited colonization if we're smart about it."

"The data supports research station only. Bringing colonists to those high-altitude zones is gambling with their health."

"All colonization involves risk. We've calculated acceptable exposure thresholds. Medical monitoring can catch problems before they become serious."

"You're assuming colonists will maintain perfect protocol compliance. That atmospheric processing systems won't fail. That long-term exposure won't cause cumulative damage we haven't detected yet."

Another six-hour delay. "I'm assuming we can engineer solutions to the problems we've identified. That's what humanity does, Marcus. We adapt. We build technology to overcome environmental challenges."

Marcus pulled up the medical data from his own team. Rafael's dopamine spike. Ling's cellular damage. Priya's tremors. All from three weeks of imperfect exposure control.

"And when the engineering fails? When a filter malfunctions and an entire habitat gets exposed to neurotoxin concentrations that cause permanent damage?"

Six hours. "Then we learn from the failure and improve the systems. That's how colonization works. Early settlers take risks so later generations can thrive."

"You're asking people to be guinea pigs."

"I'm offering them a choice. Stay on overcrowded stations or accept calculated risks for the chance at planetary life. Many will choose the risk."

Marcus thought about the colonist ships. Eighteen thousand people who'd already chosen risk by leaving Earth. Who'd accepted that colonization meant danger.

But had they consented to neurotoxic exposure? To living on a planet that was actively poisoning them?

"Fleet is going to approve your recommendation, aren't they?"

"Fleet has already approved preliminary colonization. First wave launches in six weeks. Five hundred volunteers with full disclosure of risks."

Five hundred people. Volunteers. Fully informed of the dangers.

Marcus pulled up the volunteer profiles. Engineers. Scientists. Medical personnel. People who understood the risks and accepted them anyway.

He felt the certainty draining from his objections. If people wanted to take the risk, knowing the dangers, did he have the right to stop them?

"What if you're wrong? What if the high-altitude zones aren't as safe as you calculate?"

"Then we'll find out and adjust. But Marcus, we can't keep rejecting every planet that isn't perfect. Earth wasn't perfect when humans evolved. We adapted to our environment. We can adapt to Kepler-442d too."

Six hours of delay gave Marcus time to think. To review the data. To question his own certainty.

Maybe Sarah was right. Maybe he was being overly cautious. Rejecting possibilities because they carried risks that determined people might accept.

Or maybe she was being pressured by Fleet and corporate interests to recommend colonization regardless of the dangers.

Marcus pulled up his original report. Forty-seven pages of careful analysis. Every conclusion supported by evidence.

But evidence could be interpreted different ways. Risk could be calculated with different values for human adaptability and technological capability.

He started composing a response. "Sarah, I respect your analysis. But I'm filing a formal objection to Fleet's colonization approval. The medical risks are real. We're not ready to manage them safely."

Six hours later: "Your objection is noted. But unless you have new data that contradicts our findings, Fleet won't reverse approval. The volunteers are informed. The colony will proceed."

Marcus pulled up the volunteer profiles again. Their faces. Their qualifications. Their reasons for accepting the risks.

"I want to help my children grow up on a real planet, not a rotating habitat." - Engineer Yuki Tanaka, age thirty-seven.

"This is the most exciting scientific opportunity of our generation. Worth the risk." - Xenobiologist Dr. James Okonkwo, age forty-two.

"Earth is dying. The stations are overcrowded. We need new worlds, whatever the cost." - Agricultural specialist Maria Rodriguez, age twenty-nine.

People making informed choices. Accepting dangers for the chance at something better.

Was he paternalistically protecting them from their own decisions?

Or was he the only one willing to say the risks were unacceptable?

Marcus didn't know anymore.

He pulled up the Fleet approval documents. Limited colonization authorized. High-altitude zone designated as primary settlement area. Atmospheric processing requirements specified. Medical monitoring protocols mandated.

All the precautions Sarah's team recommended. All the engineering solutions designed to make colonization feasible.

Maybe it would work. Maybe the volunteers would thrive. Maybe in fifty years, Kepler-442d would host thriving colonies that proved his caution was unnecessary.

Or maybe in five years, they'd be evacuating poisoned colonists and documenting another failed settlement.

Marcus had done his job. Documented the risks. Provided evidence. Made his recommendations.

Fleet had made different choices. And five hundred volunteers had accepted those choices.

He pulled up course projections. The survey ship was two weeks from Kepler-452b. Another planet to assess. Another chance to find somewhere truly compatible.

But part of him would always wonder about Kepler-442d. About the colonists who'd chosen to settle there despite the warnings.

Would they prove him wrong? Or vindicate his caution?

Marcus filed his formal objection with Fleet Command. Attached his original report and medical data. Made it clear he considered the colonization authorization premature and dangerous.

Then he closed the files and focused on Kepler-452b.

His job was to survey planets. To document what he found. To make honest recommendations.

Fleet's job was to weigh those recommendations against political pressure, resource needs, and volunteer willingness to accept risks.

He'd done his part. The rest was out of his control.

Marcus pulled up images of Kepler-442d one last time. The Crystal Forest glowing with alien light. Silicon photosynthesizers breathing through semiconductor reactions. Dual biospheres creating chemical complexity.

Beautiful and dangerous and about to become humanity's newest colony.

He hoped the volunteers knew what they were getting into.

Hoped the engineering solutions worked as designed.

Hoped he was wrong about the risks.

Because five hundred people were betting their lives on it.

And Marcus had run out of ways to protect them from their own choices.

He closed the images and prepared for Kepler-452b survey operations.

The work continued. The search for better options. The hope that somewhere in the galaxy, a planet existed that didn't require gambling with human health.

Until they found it, people would keep making risky choices. Keep settling marginal worlds. Keep betting on engineering solutions to overcome biochemical incompatibility.

Marcus would keep documenting the risks. Keep providing honest assessments. Keep hoping Fleet would listen.

But he wouldn't stop surveying. Wouldn't give up the search.

Because somewhere out there was a planet that would prove compatible. Where colonists could thrive without neurotoxic exposure. Where humanity's expansion didn't require accepting unacceptable dangers.

He had to believe that. Had to keep looking.

Even when the politics of colonization overrode the science of safety.

Even when volunteers chose risks he'd warned against.

Even when Fleet approved settlements he'd recommended against.

Marcus pulled up the Kepler-452b survey plan and got to work.

The next planet. The next hope. The next chance to find something better.
