The cargo bay smelled of ozone and hydraulic fluid. Chen's engineering team had the main drive array spread across three workbenches, each component tagged and catalogued.

"Tell me something good," Elena said.

Chief Engineer Sarah Chen looked up from a tangle of superconducting cables. Her hands were steady despite the sixteen-hour shift. "The good news is the reactor's stable. Bad news is everything else."

Elena leaned over the primary coupling assembly. Scorch marks ran along the housing—evidence of the overload that had nearly killed them all.

"How bad?"

"We're running at sixty percent capacity. The jump drive's completely offline until I can fabricate replacement coils." Chen wiped her hands on a rag that was probably dirtier than her fingers. "Three weeks, minimum."

"We don't have three weeks."

"Then I suggest you make friends with whatever's out there, because we're not outrunning it."

Elena studied the damage. The coupling had failed during their last jump, dumping exotic particles through the containment field. Only Chen's quick thinking had prevented a cascading failure that would've torn the ship apart.

"What about the secondaries?"

"Functional. Barely." Chen pulled up a diagnostic on her tablet. "I can give you maneuvering thrusters and basic propulsion. Enough to hold station or make orbit. But no FTL, no high-g burns."

"Weapons?"

"Point defense is operational. Railguns are offline—they draw too much from the primary grid." Chen set down the tablet. "Captain, if we have to fight, we're going to lose."

Elena had already reached the same conclusion. The Meridian was a research vessel, not a warship. Even at full capacity, they'd be outgunned by anything military-grade.

"Then we don't fight," Elena said. "We think."

"Thinking's your department. Mine is keeping us alive long enough for you to do it." Chen grabbed another cable assembly. "I'll squeeze what I can from the reactors. Maybe get us to seventy percent."

"Do it. And Chen?" Elena paused at the hatch. "Good work keeping us in one piece."

"Thank me when we're home, Captain."

Elena nodded and left. In the corridor outside, the ship's lights flickered—just for a moment, barely noticeable. But Elena noticed everything these days.

The Meridian was dying. And they were still three weeks from the nearest station.
