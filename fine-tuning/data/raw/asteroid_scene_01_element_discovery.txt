Captain Torres watched the asteroid grow in the viewscreen. Designation: 2174-KR. Composition: carbonaceous chondrite with unusual metallic inclusions. Value: unknown.

Potentially infinite.

"Final approach in thirty minutes," Kayla reported from the pilot station. "I'm reading some weird gravitational fluctuations. Could be a dense core."

"Or could be exactly what we're hoping for." Sofia Ruiz didn't look up from her spectral analysis. "Those metallic signatures aren't random distribution. There's a concentration pattern."

Torres studied the readings. The Rock Hopper had been prospecting for six months with nothing but ice and worthless silicates. They needed a score. The lease on the ship was coming due, and the bank didn't care about bad luck.

"Wrench, how's the mining rig looking?" Torres asked.

Chen's voice crackled from engineering. "Operational. Mostly. Don't ask me to mine anything harder than carbonaceous material until I replace the drill actuators."

"When have we ever had it easy?" Torres smiled. "Kayla, take us in nice and gentle. Last thing we need is to scratch the paint on a worthless rock."

The Rock Hopper settled onto the asteroid's surface with barely a whisper. Point-three percent local gravity meant everything moved in slow motion.

Torres suited up with Sofia. First survey was always captain and chief scientist—protocol from when mining operations were corporate ventures with safety regulations. Now it was just Torres, his crew, and whatever the void provided.

The asteroid's surface was rough, pockmarked by ancient impacts. Torres activated his scanner, mapping as they walked.

"Getting elevated readings a hundred meters north," Sofia said. "Consistent with concentrated metallic deposits."

They crossed the distance in long, low-gravity bounds. The deposit site was marked by a slight discoloration—darker material against the gray-black stone.

Sofia took a core sample. Torres watched her expression change from professional interest to stunned disbelief.

"What is it?"

"Element 126." Her voice was quiet. "Synthesized superheavy element. Island of stability. It shouldn't exist outside a lab."

Torres felt his heart rate spike. Element 126 was theoretical—atomic number that required enormous energy to create and quantum stabilization to maintain. A few atoms had been synthesized on Earth at costs that made platinum look like gravel.

This asteroid had a concentrated deposit.

"How much?" he asked.

Sofia ran the numbers. "Based on these readings? Three hundred kilograms. Maybe more."

Torres did the math. At current market rates, that was enough money to buy a fleet of mining ships. Enough to retire every crew member. Enough to make Earth Corp's biggest executives look poor.

Enough to get them killed if the wrong people found out.

"We don't report this," Torres said.

"Captain—"

"Not yet. Not until we have it extracted and secured." Torres pulled up the claim beacon controls. "We file a standard mining claim, carbonaceous asteroid, routine exploitation. Nothing unusual."

"That's falsifying a claim report. It's illegal."

"So is claim jumping, but that won't stop the corporations from seizing this site the moment they realize what's here." Torres activated the beacon. "Standard protocols, Sofia. We mine, we secure, then we figure out how to sell it without getting robbed."

They returned to the ship. Torres gathered the crew in the common area.

"We've got a situation," he said. "The asteroid is valuable. Extremely valuable. Which means we're in danger the moment anyone finds out what we're sitting on."

"How valuable?" Kayla asked.

"Retire-forever valuable. Buy-your-own-station valuable." Torres pulled up the scan data. "Element 126. Concentrated deposit. Natural occurrence, which shouldn't be possible but apparently is."

Wrench whistled. "That's military-grade material. The defense contractors will pay anything for that."

"Exactly. Which means we need to be careful who we approach." Torres looked at each crew member. "This is decision time. We can file an honest claim report, let Earth Corp or one of the mega-corps handle exploitation, and accept whatever finder's fee they decide to give us. Or we extract it ourselves, find a buyer we trust, and keep the full value."

"The first option is legal," Sofia said.

"The first option makes us poor," Kayla countered. "I didn't spend six months in the void for a finder's fee."

"The second option could get us killed," Wrench added. "These corps don't negotiate. They take what they want and deal with the consequences later."

Torres nodded. "I know. That's why it's a crew decision. I won't order anyone into this."

Silence. The ship hummed around them, life support and reactor and a thousand small systems keeping them alive in the void.

"I'm in," Kayla said. "But we do this smart. Extract carefully, move it off-site, establish redundant hiding spots."

"Agreed." Wrench stood. "I'll start prepping the mining rig. We'll need specialized equipment for element 126. It's unstable—wrong handling could destabilize the atomic structure."

"I'll research the mineral formation," Sofia said. "If we understand how it formed naturally, we might find more deposits."

Torres felt relief and terror in equal measure. They'd committed to the dangerous path. Now they had to execute perfectly.

The extraction took four days. Wrench jury-rigged containment fields to stabilize the element during mining. Sofia documented everything—mineral composition, formation patterns, surrounding geology. Kayla ran continuous scans for approaching ships.

No one came. The void was empty and indifferent.

They loaded the element 126 into shielded containers. Three hundred and forty kilograms total. Torres stored them in the cargo bay and encrypted the inventory logs.

"Now what?" Sofia asked.

"Now we find a buyer." Torres pulled up his contact list. Sixteen years of independent mining had given him connections—merchants, brokers, gray-market traders who asked few questions. "Someone discreet. Someone who won't immediately sell us out to the highest bidder."

"That's a short list," Kayla observed.

"Very short." Torres composed a message, carefully worded. Rare mineral deposit. Exclusive opportunity. Interested parties only.

He sent it to three contacts he trusted. Or trusted as much as anyone trusted anyone in the mining business.

Two days later, the responses came back. One declined—too risky. One offered an insultingly low price. The third wanted to meet in person.

"Nakamura Station," Torres said. "Neutral territory. He's bringing an assayer."

"It's a trap," Wrench said.

"Probably. But if we don't sell this soon, we'll have to keep moving, keep hiding. Eventually someone will get suspicious." Torres checked the coordinates. "Three-day burn. We go in prepared. Combat protocols, encrypted communications, dead man's switch on the cargo."

"Dead man's switch?" Sofia looked alarmed.

"Insurance. If something happens to us, the cargo self-destructs. Makes it worthless to steal." Torres smiled grimly. "They want the element 126, they play fair."

The journey to Nakamura Station was tense. They rotated watch shifts, monitored sensors obsessively, jumped at every contact ping.

Nothing happened.

They docked at Nakamura on schedule. The buyer—a slight man named Takeshi with expensive implants and careful eyes—met them at the airlock.

"Captain Torres. Pleasure."

"Let's skip the pleasantries. You wanted to see the merchandise."

Takeshi's assayer examined a sample. Ran spectral analysis. Verified authenticity. His expression remained neutral, but Torres saw the calculations behind his eyes.

"It's legitimate," the assayer said. "Natural element 126. I've never seen a deposit this large."

"Price?" Torres asked.

Takeshi named a figure. It was high. Not as high as Torres wanted, but high enough to make the risk worthwhile.

"That's for half the deposit," Torres countered. "The full amount is worth triple."

"Triple is ambitious."

"Triple is fair for a resource that shouldn't exist in nature. You'll sell it to the defense contractors for ten times what you pay me."

Takeshi smiled. "You've done your research."

"I've survived sixteen years by knowing the market." Torres met his eyes. "I'm offering you a fortune. All I ask is fair compensation."

They negotiated for two hours. Torres held firm. Takeshi respected that—or at least respected the leverage.

Final price: 2.4 times the original offer.

Torres accepted.

The transfer happened immediately. Cryptocurrency, untraceable, split across six accounts. The containers changed hands.

Torres and his crew departed Nakamura Station three hours later, considerably wealthier and significantly more paranoid.

"Think he'll come after us?" Kayla asked as they cleared the station.

"Doubt it. He got what he wanted at a price he could justify." Torres checked their accounts. The numbers were real. "But we're still exposed. Anyone who checks the claim beacon will notice the discrepancy."

"So we file an amended report," Sofia suggested. "Claim was more productive than initial survey indicated. We sold the extraction rights."

"That works." Torres relaxed slightly. "Set course for the belt. We'll lie low for a while, let this fade from memory."

Wrench appeared with a bottle of recycled ethanol. "Success deserves celebration."

They drank. Not to excess—spacers never drank to excess—but enough to feel the warmth and relief.

"What now?" Sofia asked. "We could retire on this score."

"We could," Torres agreed. "But would you want to?"

Silence. Then Kayla laughed. "Hell no. Two months of retirement and I'd be crawling the walls."

"Then we keep prospecting. Stay independent. Do this on our terms." Torres raised his glass. "To the Rock Hopper. And to finding more impossible things in the void."

They drank to that.

Outside, the asteroid belt stretched endless and full of secrets.

They'd found one.

There would be more.
