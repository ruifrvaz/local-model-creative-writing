The hab module's foundation crack appeared during routine inspection.

Alexis Kwan stared at the structural scan, her stomach sinking. The crack ran three meters along the eastern support beam. Not catastrophic yet. But growing.

"How long has this been developing?" Commander Rivera asked.

"Unknown. Could be days, could be months." Alexis pulled up the stress analysis. "The subsurface cavity Hassan found—it's closer than we thought. Ground settling is affecting our foundations."

"Can we stabilize it?"

"Short term, yes. Long term?" Alexis highlighted the geological survey. "We need to understand what's under us. That means excavating the cavity. Actually going down there."

Rivera processed that. "Hassan's been requesting a subsurface expedition for weeks. Corporate keeps denying it."

"Then corporate doesn't get a vote anymore." Alexis pulled up the engineering specs. "We're looking at potential colony collapse if this continues. I'm authorizing the expedition under emergency protocols."

"That's my call, Chief."

"Then make it, Commander." Alexis met her eyes. "Because I'm going down either way. With or without authorization."

Rivera smiled slightly. "You're terrible at chain of command."

"I'm excellent at keeping people alive." Alexis grabbed her equipment kit. "Hassan's been preparing for this. We can be in the cavity within six hours."

The expedition team assembled in the engineering bay. Hassan, naturally. Tanaka, because someone had to monitor life support. And Alexis, because delegation wasn't her strong suit.

The drilling equipment cut through regolith with methodical precision. Three hours to reach the cavity depth. Another hour to create a safe entry point.

When the drill broke through, Alexis's suit sensors detected the open space below. Large. Much larger than the initial scans suggested.

"I'm reading five hundred cubic meters," Hassan reported. "This isn't a cavity. It's a chamber."

Alexis lowered herself through the entry shaft, helmet lights cutting through absolute darkness. The chamber walls were smooth. Too smooth for natural formation.

"We're looking at artificial construction," she said. "Age: unknown. Purpose: unknown. But definitely built."

Tanaka descended next, her sensors scanning for atmospheric hazards. "No biologicals. No radiation. Just... emptiness."

Hassan came last, his geological instruments already recording data. "The walls are fused regolith. Melted and shaped, probably with directed energy. This required significant technology."

The chamber extended in three directions. Corridors branching into darkness. Alexis chose the widest and began exploring.

The corridor opened into a larger space. Alexis's lights revealed shapes—structures, possibly equipment, covered in Martian dust.

"I'm seeing artifacts," she reported. "Technological artifacts. Definitely not human origin."

She approached the nearest structure. Roughly cylindrical, two meters tall, covered in geometric patterns. Not random. Intentional. Possibly writing.

"Hassan, you seeing this?"

"Seeing it. Not believing it." Hassan's voice shook with excitement. "Alexis, this is architecture. This is technology. This is proof of prior civilization on Mars."

"Or proof that someone visited Mars before we did." Alexis examined the patterns. "Could be human. Ancient human expedition we don't know about."

"The fused regolith dates to at least fifty thousand years," Hassan countered. "Humans weren't leaving Earth then."

"So we're looking at alien construction. On Mars. Under our colony." Tanaka's voice was steady despite the implications. "What do we do?"

"Document everything," Alexis said. "And then we figure out how to stabilize our foundations without destroying archaeological evidence."

They worked for hours. Recording, scanning, photographing. Every surface, every artifact, every detail. Hassan was in heaven—the geological discovery of the century.

Alexis was more practical. The chamber was compromising colony stability. They needed solutions, not just documentation.

"Can we reinforce the cavity without collapsing it?" she asked Hassan.

"Maybe. If we install support pillars, distribute the load differently." Hassan pulled up structural calculations. "But it means permanent construction in an alien archaeological site."

"The alternative is abandoning the colony or risking collapse."

"Or we relocate the colony," Tanaka suggested. "Build elsewhere, preserve this site intact."

Alexis considered. "That's years of work. Massive resource expenditure. Corporate will never approve it."

"Then we don't ask corporate." Hassan's voice was firm. "We go public. International scientific community, space agencies, academic institutions. Make this discovery public and let them pressure corporate."

"That's career suicide," Tanaka said.

"That's preservation of human knowledge," Hassan countered. "This is bigger than careers. This is bigger than Mars."

Alexis looked around the chamber. Alien technology. Evidence of intelligence beyond Earth. Proof that humans weren't alone.

Or hadn't been alone.

"We do both," she decided. "Reinforce the cavity to protect the colony. Publish the discovery to protect the site. Corporate can deal with the consequences."

They returned to the surface with terabytes of data and revolutionary evidence.

Rivera listened to their report with growing amazement. "You found an alien structure. Under our colony."

"Ancient alien structure," Hassan corrected. "At least fifty thousand years old. Possibly older."

"And our foundations are sitting on top of it."

"Which is why we need to reinforce immediately," Alexis said. "I can install support structures within three days. Stabilize the colony, preserve the site."

Rivera pulled up the corporate communication schedule. "They're going to want to classify this. Bury it under national security protocols."

"Which is why we publish first," Hassan said. "Tonight. Multiple journals, multiple institutions. Make it impossible to suppress."

"That violates every protocol we have."

"The protocols weren't designed for discovering alien civilizations." Alexis met Rivera's eyes. "Commander, this is a choice. Follow rules that will bury the truth, or break rules to preserve it."

Rivera was quiet for a long time. Then she pulled up her secure terminal. "Dr. Hassan, draft your paper. Chief Kwan, start your reinforcement work. I'll handle corporate."

"How?" Alexis asked.

"By telling them the truth hit the journals before I could stop it." Rivera smiled. "Plausible deniability. I'm terrible at information security."

The publication went live at 0200 station time. Multiple journals, multiple datasets, multiple institutions. Complete transparency.

By 0600, the messages started flooding in. Scientific community, government agencies, media outlets. Everyone wanting more information, more data, more access.

Corporate's response came at 0800. Furious. Threatening. Demanding explanations.

Rivera handled it with political grace. Yes, the discovery was real. No, she couldn't have stopped it. Yes, she understood the implications. No, the colony wouldn't be compromised.

Alexis spent the next three days installing support pillars in the chamber. Careful work, preserving artifacts while ensuring structural stability. The pillars were temporary—eventually, proper archaeological teams would need permanent solutions.

But for now, the colony was safe. And the site was protected.

Hassan gave interviews to everyone who asked. Scientific significance, historical implications, the future of Mars exploration. He was in his element.

Tanaka monitored colony systems, ensuring the reinforcement work didn't cause secondary problems. Everything remained stable.

On the fourth day, Earth announced a joint international expedition. Scientific teams, archaeological specialists, xenotechnology experts. They'd be arriving within six months.

Mars had just become the center of human attention.

And the colony—corporate's budget-driven outpost—had become a historical landmark.

Rivera called a staff meeting. "Corporate's sending new management. More funding, better equipment, actual support infrastructure."

"Took an alien discovery to get them to invest properly," Alexis observed.

"Sometimes you have to break the rules to get the right attention." Rivera pulled up the new colony plans. "We're expanding. Building a proper research facility. Mars is going to be more than a corporate project."

"Good," Hassan said. "It should be. This discovery belongs to everyone."

Alexis looked at the subsurface scan. The chamber, the corridors, the artifacts. All preserved now. Protected.

They'd come to Mars to establish a colony. They'd found something bigger.

Evidence that intelligence had touched Mars before. That humans weren't the first to look at the red planet and see possibility.

The foundations were secure now. Both literally and figuratively.

And whatever came next, they'd face it with stronger structures and better knowledge.

That was engineering. That was science.

That was the future.
