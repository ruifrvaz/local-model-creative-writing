Engineer Malik Torres stood in the observation dome, watching a planet that shouldn't exist.

The generation ship Endurance had been traveling for two hundred years. Destination: Tau Ceti. ETA: two hundred more years.

Except now, thirty light-years from home and forty from destination, they'd found something.

A planet. Orbiting a G-type star. Atmospheric composition: breathable. Water: abundant. Temperature range: marginal but survivable.

Not perfect. But possible.

"Tell me what you're thinking," Captain Ana Reyes said, joining him at the viewport.

"I'm thinking my grandparents never saw a planet. My parents never will. And here's one, right in front of us."

"It's not Tau Ceti."

"No. It's closer. Reachable in our lifetime." Malik pulled up the survey data. "We could settle this world. Raise our children under open sky instead of inside metal walls."

Ana was quiet. She'd been born on Endurance. So had her mother. Third-generation captain, bound by oath to complete the original mission.

"The council is voting tomorrow," she said. "On whether to divert course."

"How will you vote?"

"I don't get a vote. I execute the decision, whatever it is." Ana looked at the planet. "But between us? I don't know what I'd choose."

Malik understood. The mission was sacred. Eight thousand people traveling across centuries to establish humanity's first extrasolar colony. Generations had lived and died for this purpose.

But that was before they'd found an alternative. A chance to end the voyage now. To step onto solid ground and build something permanent.

"Medical Director Okoye is presenting his report tomorrow," Malik said. "Genetic analysis."

"I've seen it. We're degrading. Faster than the original projections."

"Another two hundred years and we might not be viable as a population."

"Might not. The models aren't certain." Ana turned from the viewport. "Malik, I need your honest assessment. As chief engineer. Can this ship survive another two hundred years?"

He'd been dreading that question. "If everything goes perfectly? Yes. The hull is sound. The fusion reactors are operating within specifications. Life support is stable."

"But?"

"But we've had three critical failures in the last decade. The deuterium recycler. The primary computer core. The agricultural bay radiation shielding." Malik pulled up the maintenance logs. "Each time, we patched it. Made it work. But our spare parts inventory is depleting. And we can't manufacture some components."

"So the ship is dying."

"The ship is aging. There's a difference. With proper maintenance, it'll last. But every year, the margins get tighter."

Ana was quiet for a long moment. "The vote tomorrow will split the colony."

"It already has." Malik gestured to the planet below. "Half the crew wants to settle. The other half wants to honor the mission."

"And you?"

Malik thought about his daughter. Seven years old. Born between stars. She'd never run on grass. Never felt rain. Never seen a horizon that wasn't metal wall.

"I want her to have choices," he said. "The mission gave us purpose. But maybe it's time to let go of purposes chosen by people who died centuries ago."

"That's heresy, Engineer."

"That's honesty, Captain."

Ana smiled sadly. "Tomorrow will be interesting. One way or another."

She left. Malik stayed at the viewport, watching the planet rotate below. Continents. Oceans. Weather patterns. All the messy, beautiful complexity of a living world.

Behind him, the Endurance hummed with the sound of eight thousand people living compressed lives in limited space. Generations who'd known only metal and recycled air.

Tomorrow, they'd vote. Stay the course or change everything.

And Malik would have to live with the consequences.

Either way.

The next morning, Council Chamber One filled to capacity. Eight thousand people couldn't fit, but the session was broadcast ship-wide.

Historian Dr. Eva Sato spoke first. "Our ancestors left Earth with a sacred mission. To reach Tau Ceti. To establish a permanent human presence in a carefully chosen system. We've spent two hundred years working toward that goal."

"And we can spend two hundred more dying for it," Medical Director James Okoye countered. "The genetic analysis is clear. Our population is experiencing bottleneck effects. Increased genetic disorders. Declining immune function. Another two hundred years could render us unable to colonize anything."

"Could. Not will." Eva pulled up the genetic models. "There's uncertainty in the projections."

"Uncertainty that grows with every generation." Okoye highlighted the degradation curves. "We need genetic diversity. Fresh environmental pressures. Things only a planet can provide."

The debate continued. Historical arguments versus medical data. Mission purity versus practical survival.

Malik watched from the engineering section. Beside him, other engineers whispered predictions.

"Sixty-forty in favor of diversion," Chen said.

"You're optimistic," Rodriguez replied. "The traditionalists are loud. I'd say fifty-five-forty-five against."

The vote was called at noon.

The results came in slowly. Each section reporting. Each voice counted.

Final tally: 4,203 for diversion. 3,797 for continuing to Tau Ceti.

The colony would settle the new world.

By 406 votes.

Malik felt relief and dread in equal measure. They'd made the choice. But at what cost?

Around him, engineers cheered. The mission was over. They could land. Build. Survive.

But in other sections, silence. Or anger. The traditionalists had lost.

Ana's voice came over the ship-wide comm. "Attention all personnel. The vote is final and binding. We will initiate deceleration protocols and prepare for planetary settlement. Department heads, report to the command center for mission planning."

Professional. Calm. Hiding whatever she really felt.

Malik headed for command. The corridors were chaotic. People celebrating. People arguing. The social fabric of the ship straining under sudden change.

He passed a memorial wall. Names of every person who'd died aboard Endurance. Two hundred years of sacrifice. Generations who'd lived their entire lives for a mission now abandoned.

What would they think? Would they understand? Or would they see this as betrayal?

Malik didn't know. Couldn't know.

He reached the command center. Ana was already there, with Okoye, Eva, and the other department heads.

"We have work to do," Ana said without preamble. "Deceleration will take six months. During that time, we need to prepare landing protocols, survey teams, and settlement infrastructure."

"We also need to address the dissent," Eva said quietly. "Forty-seven percent of the colony voted against this. We can't ignore them."

"We won't. But the decision is made." Ana pulled up the planetary survey. "Our priority is survival. Building a sustainable settlement. Once we're stable, we can address philosophical differences."

"And if the traditionalists refuse to cooperate?" Okoye asked.

"Then we deal with that when it happens." Ana's tone was firm. "Malik, what do you need for the landing?"

He pulled up his preliminary calculations. "Structural reinforcement for atmospheric entry. Conversion of cargo bays to landing craft. Heat shielding. Parachute systems." The list was long. "We're not designed to land. We'll have to rebuild half the ship into descent vehicles."

"Time frame?"

"Six months is tight. But possible."

"Make it happen." Ana looked around the table. "This is the most important operation in Endurance's history. We're not just changing course. We're ending a two-hundred-year mission and beginning something new."

"Or abandoning our purpose," Eva said softly.

Ana met her gaze. "Eva, I respect your position. But the vote was clear. We proceed."

The meeting continued for three hours. Planning. Logistics. Contingencies.

By the time Malik returned to engineering, he was exhausted. But there was work to do. The Endurance needed to transform from an interstellar ark into a landing fleet.

He pulled up the structural diagrams. Calculated stress loads. Designed heat shields from materials meant for micrometeorite protection.

Everything would have to be repurposed. Improvised. Made to work in ways the original designers never imagined.

Just like the colony itself. Repurposing ancient missions for modern survival.

Outside the viewport, the planet waited. Green and blue and full of possibilities.

And risks. And unknowns.

But it was theirs now. For better or worse.

The vote was final. The mission changed.

All that remained was making it work.
