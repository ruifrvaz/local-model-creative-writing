The vote was scheduled for 1900. Malik Torres watched the council chamber fill with representatives from every section of the generation ship Covenant.

Two hundred years into a four-hundred-year journey. Halfway to a destination their great-grandchildren would never see.

Unless they abandoned the mission.

"The survey data is clear," Dr. James Okoye stood at the presentation console. "Kepler-442c shows ninety-three percent habitability. Oxygen atmosphere, liquid water, temperature range compatible with human survival. It's twenty light-years off our planned route, but achievable with course correction."

"Achievable at significant fuel cost," Engineer Nguyen countered. "Diverting to Kepler-442c would consume thirty percent of our remaining reaction mass. That's our safety margin."

"Safety margin for a journey we might not survive anyway." Okoye pulled up genetic analysis charts. "Our population shows increasing genetic bottleneck effects. Immune system degradation, elevated cancer rates, recessive disorder expression. We need genetic diversity that our current population can't provide."

Malik listened from the gallery. The arguments were familiar—he'd heard them in every public forum for the past six months. The Settlers wanted to divert to Kepler-442c. The Continuers wanted to maintain the original mission to Tau Ceti.

He was Covenant-born. Third generation. The only Earth he knew existed in the ship's historical archives. Tau Ceti was just coordinates on a navigation display.

But it was the mission. The purpose his grandparents had sacrificed everything to achieve.

Captain Ana Reyes called for order. "We've heard the scientific arguments. Now we vote. This is a binding decision—whatever the council chooses, we implement."

The representatives began voting. Electronic tallies appeared on the main display.

Malik watched the numbers climb. Settlers: 28. Continuers: 24. Abstentions: 3.

A margin of four votes to abandon four hundred years of purpose.

"Motion carries," Reyes announced. "We divert to Kepler-442c. Implementation begins immediately."

Malik felt something crack inside. He stood and left before the chamber erupted in cheers and protests.

The observation deck was empty. Malik pressed his hand against the viewport, staring at the stars. They looked the same as always—distant, cold, indifferent.

"You disagree with the vote."

Malik turned. Dr. Eva Sato, the ship's historian, approached slowly.

"Doesn't matter what I think. The council decided."

"Democracy doesn't erase doubt." Eva joined him at the viewport. "You think we're betraying the mission."

"My grandparents gave up Earth to reach Tau Ceti. Now we're abandoning that because the journey is hard." Malik gestured at the stars. "What's the point of generation ships if we quit halfway?"

"The point is survival. Genetic viability. Giving our children a future." Eva pulled up a data tablet. "James showed me the projections. Without fresh genetic material, the population crashes in six generations."

"Projections aren't certainties."

"No. But they're warnings. Ignoring them doesn't make us noble. It makes us stupid."

Malik wanted to argue. But Eva wasn't wrong. The genetic bottleneck was real. The Covenant's population of eight thousand wasn't sustainable over centuries.

"Kepler-442c might be habitable, but it's not Tau Ceti," he said. "We don't know what's there. What diseases, what environmental hazards. The mission was planned for a specific destination."

"Missions change. Humanity changes. We adapt or we die." Eva looked at the stars. "My job is preserving Earth's culture. But culture only matters if there are people alive to practice it."

The ship's engines fired that evening. A low thrrum that resonated through the hull. Course correction burn—the first major change in trajectory since Malik was born.

They were turning away from Tau Ceti.

Toward an unknown world.

Malik worked his shift in engineering, monitoring the burn sequence. Nguyen supervised with tight-jawed tension—he'd voted to Continue, lost the vote, and now had to implement the decision he opposed.

"Burn sequence nominal," Malik reported. "Delta-V accumulation on track."

Nguyen grunted acknowledgment. Professional to the core, even in defeat.

The burn lasted six hours. When it finished, the Covenant's trajectory had shifted three point seven degrees. A small change that would accumulate over decades into an entirely different destination.

Malik checked the navigation display. Tau Ceti was no longer in their path. Kepler-442c was.

The decision was irreversible.

That night, Malik visited the Archive—a section of the ship dedicated to Earth history. Images, videos, cultural artifacts. Everything their ancestors had brought from a world two hundred years and twelve light-years behind them.

Eva was there, cataloging recent recordings.

"Couldn't sleep?" she asked.

"Can't stop thinking about what we've lost."

"We haven't lost anything. We've chosen a different path." Eva pulled up Earth images. "These people—our ancestors—they left Earth knowing they'd never return. Knowing their children would be born in space and die in space. That took faith."

"Faith in the mission. In reaching Tau Ceti."

"Faith in humanity's future. The destination was symbolic. What mattered was the choice to go forward." Eva zoomed in on an image—the Covenant under construction, Earth visible in the background. "They didn't build this ship for Tau Ceti. They built it so humanity could survive. We're honoring that by choosing survival over symbolism."

Malik studied the image. The Covenant was massive—ten kilometers long, home to eight thousand souls crossing the void. A self-contained civilization.

"You think we'll make it?" he asked. "To Kepler-442c?"

"I think we'll try. That's all anyone can do."

The ship settled into new routines. Course corrections every few months as they refined their trajectory. The Settlers celebrated—planning for the approach, studying Kepler-442c's characteristics, preparing for landfall.

The Continuers mourned quietly. Some refused to participate in planning. Others reluctantly adapted, recognizing that divided loyalty served no one.

Malik found himself somewhere between.

He worked his engineering shifts, maintained the systems that kept eight thousand people alive. But he also studied Kepler-442c. Learned its atmospheric composition, its orbital period, its surface conditions.

Ninety-three percent habitable. Not perfect. Not Earth.

But possible.

Five years after the vote, a child was born. First generation to grow up knowing they'd see their destination planet.

They named her Hope.

Malik attended the naming ceremony. Watched the parents introduce their daughter to the community. Saw the joy and relief in their faces.

This was why they'd diverted. For children who could have futures beyond ship corridors and recycled air.

Eva found him after the ceremony.

"Changed your mind?" she asked.

"Maybe. A little." Malik watched Hope sleep peacefully. "Still wish we'd made it to Tau Ceti."

"We might have. Or we might have died trying." Eva smiled. "This way, we live. That's worth something."

The Covenant sailed on. Not toward the destination it had left Earth to reach, but toward a future chosen by necessity and hope.

Malik still thought about Tau Ceti sometimes. Wondered what it would have been like. Wondered if they'd abandoned something irreplaceable.

But he also thought about Hope. And the hundreds of other children who would be born in the coming decades.

A generation who would set foot on solid ground.

Who would build a civilization under an alien sun.

Who would prove that humanity could start again.

The mission had changed.

But it hadn't ended.

And maybe, Malik thought, that was enough.
