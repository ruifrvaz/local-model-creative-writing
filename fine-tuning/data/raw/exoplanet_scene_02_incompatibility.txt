Rafael Diaz woke to the sound of screaming plants.

He lay in his bunk for three seconds, trying to convince himself it was a dream. Then his neural implant picked up the signals again—distress markers broadcasting on frequencies that shouldn't exist in nature.

The alien flora was communicating. And it was terrified.

Rafael grabbed his scanner and ran for the greenhouse. The expedition had brought samples back three days ago—crystalline structures, bioluminescent fungi, what they'd categorized as "probable photosynthetic organisms" despite lacking chlorophyll.

Everything was dying.

The crystal trees were turning black. The fungi had collapsed into puddles of viscous fluid. Even the soil samples were degrading, releasing compounds that made his eyes water.

"What did you do?" Dr. Kapoor appeared behind him, her atmospheric analyzer already running. "The contamination levels are spiking. Oxygen dropping. This whole section is becoming toxic."

"I didn't do anything. I just woke up to—" Rafael gestured helplessly at the dying ecosystem. "This."

Priya moved through the greenhouse, sampling everything. The crystal trees. The soil. The air itself. Her expression grew darker with each reading.

"They're allergic to us," she said finally. "Or to Earth biology. The bacterial cultures we use to process waste, the fungi in our hydroponic systems, even the microbes in our breath—everything's toxic to the alien biology."

"How is that possible? We tested for cross-contamination."

"We tested for compatibility. Not for incompatibility." Priya pulled up cellular analysis. "Look at this. The Earth bacteria are producing metabolic byproducts that break down the alien cellular structures. It's chemical warfare at a microscopic level. And we started it by bringing the samples into our ecosystem."

Rafael felt sick. "We're killing them."

"Worse. We're probably killing the entire planet." Priya activated her comm. "Marcus, we have a situation. The alien biology is incompatible with Earth life. Catastrophically incompatible. Every sample we brought back is dying from exposure to our environment."

Marcus Osei's voice came back tight. "Contamination protocols?"

"Failed. Or irrelevant. This isn't about contamination. This is about fundamental biochemical incompatibility. Oil and water. Except the oil dissolves the water and the water kills the oil." Priya closed the greenhouse door. "We need to quarantine this section. Sterilize everything. And then we need to discuss whether humans can ever set foot on this planet without destroying it."

Rafael looked at the dying crystal trees. Three days ago they'd been beautiful—alien and strange and full of life that existed in ways Earth biology had never attempted. Now they were turning to dust because he'd brought them into contact with bacteria that evolved on a different world.

"We can fix this," he said. "Separate environments. Total isolation. We keep Earth biology and alien biology completely segregated."

"For how long? Forever?" Priya gestured at the greenhouse. "Rafael, we came here to establish whether this planet is habitable. The answer is no. Not for us. Not without genociding the native life first."

"There has to be a middle ground."

"Name one." Priya pulled up the planet data. "We breathe oxygen. They produce compounds that are toxic to oxygen-breathers. We rely on bacterial cultures for everything from waste processing to food production. Those cultures are fatal to their biochemistry. We can't coexist. Not without one of us dying."

Rafael stared at the analysis. She was right. The fundamental building blocks of Earth life and this alien ecosystem were chemically antagonistic. Contact meant death. For one side or the other.

"What if we adapt?" he asked. "Modify our biology. Use the psychoactive compounds to alter our metabolism. Become something that can coexist with the native life."

"You're talking about abandoning human biology. Becoming alien ourselves."

"I'm talking about evolution. Adaptation. Isn't that what we do? Change to fit new environments?" Rafael pulled up the expedition logs. "We've been breathing the planetary atmosphere for days. The psychoactive compounds are already in our systems. Maybe that's the first step. Maybe the planet is already trying to adapt us."

Priya looked at him like he'd lost his mind. "Rafael, we can't just decide to evolve on a six-day timeline. Biology doesn't work that way."

"Earth biology doesn't. But this planet's biology might be different. Those compounds that altered our perception—what if they're not psychoactive? What if they're transformative? Designed to modify anything that enters the biosphere into something compatible?"

"That's a huge speculation."

"So was everything about this planet before we landed." Rafael moved to the dying samples. "Priya, these structures broadcast distress signals we can detect with our implants. They communicate on frequencies our neurology happens to pick up. That's either an incredible coincidence or evidence that the planet is already reaching out to us. Trying to make contact. Or trying to convert us into something it can communicate with."

Priya was quiet for a long time. Then she pulled out her medical scanner.

"Blood sample. Now."

Rafael extended his arm. The needle pierced his skin. Dark blood filled the vial.

Under the microscope, it looked almost normal. Red blood cells. White blood cells. Standard human biology.

Then Priya increased magnification.

"There." She highlighted a structure. Crystalline. Embedded in Rafael's cells. Growing. "You're already changing. The compounds aren't psychoactive. They're integrative. Rewriting your biology to make you compatible with the planet."

Rafael felt a chill. "How long?"

"Unknown. The integration is slow. Weeks. Maybe months. But it's definitely happening." Priya took her own blood sample. Same results. The crystalline structures were in her bloodstream too. "We're all transforming. Everyone who breathed the atmosphere. Everyone who touched the soil. We're becoming something else."

"Something that can survive here?"

"Something that can't survive on Earth. These structures are replacing human cellular components. Making us alien. If we go back, if we try to live in Earth's biosphere after the transformation completes, we'll die just like these samples are dying here." Priya closed the microscope. "Rafael, we're trapped. We can't go home. And we can't stay here without becoming something our families won't recognize."

Rafael thought about Earth. About the family he'd left to join this expedition. About the girlfriend who'd promised to wait two years for him to return.

He'd never see them again. Not as himself. Not as human.

"What do we tell the crew?" he asked.

"The truth. That first contact was successful. That we found alien life. And that it found us. And neither of us can survive the encounter without changing everything we are." Priya opened the greenhouse door. "Come on. Marcus needs to hear this. Then we need to decide whether to abort the mission or accept what we're becoming."

They found Marcus in the command module. The field lead listened to their report without interruption. Then he pulled up the crew medical data.

"Everyone's showing the same markers," he said. "Twelve personnel. All transforming. All caught between two biospheres and compatible with neither."

"What do we do?" Rafael asked.

Marcus looked at the planet through the viewport. The crystal forests. The alien beauty that was slowly killing them and converting them simultaneously.

"We adapt," he said. "We let the transformation complete. We become whatever this planet needs us to be. And we document everything so the next expedition knows what they're walking into."

"We'll never go home," Priya said.

"Home is a planet that's dying. Overcrowded. Desperate for resources." Marcus pulled up Earth's status reports. "We came out here to find new worlds for humanity. We found one. It just requires us to stop being human in the process."

Rafael looked at his hands. At the skin that felt the same but was restructuring at a cellular level. Becoming alien. Becoming adapted to a world that had evolved without humanity and would continue evolving with or without their participation.

"Do we vote?" he asked.

"No," Marcus said. "We're already transforming. The choice was made when we decided to breathe alien air. Now we just decide whether we embrace it or fight it. And fighting it means dying."

The command module was quiet. Twelve humans stood on the edge of transformation. On the threshold of becoming humanity's first true aliens.

Rafael thought about his girlfriend. His family. The life he'd left behind.

Then he looked at the crystal forests and felt something new stirring in his chest. Not loss. Not grief.

Curiosity. About what he might become. What they all might become.

The universe was stranger than he'd imagined. And he was about to become part of that strangeness.

It was terrifying.

And absolutely fascinating.

"I'm in," he said. "Let's see what we become."
