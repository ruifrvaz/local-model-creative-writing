Lieutenant Marcus Webb read Sarah Chen's letter for the third time and felt certainty crystallize. He'd volunteered for FTL testing knowing the risks. Now he understood what the risks actually meant.

Temporal fragmentation. Consciousness scattered across multiple moments. Body and mind existing in incompatible timeframes.

Sarah had survived. Changed, tethered to exotic physics, transformed into something post-human.

But alive. And contributing.

Marcus stood and walked to the observation window. The FTL test facility stretched below—laboratories, jump ship hangar, medical bays where Lieutenant Park lay comatose and Sarah lived in her three-meter cage.

"You're still going through with it?" Dr. Emma Torres asked from the doorway.

"I signed up to push boundaries. The boundaries are more dangerous than expected. But that doesn't change the mission."

"Sarah's letter didn't scare you away?"

"It scared me. Appropriately. But she survived. Adapted. If she can do it, maybe I can too."

Emma entered fully, carrying medical files. "Dr. Mbara wants to run additional baseline scans. Neural mapping, temporal perception tests, genetic markers that might indicate resilience to FTL effects."

"Looking for predictive factors? Ways to know who'll adapt like Sarah versus who'll collapse like Park?"

"Exactly. We're trying to reduce the uncertainty. But the sample size is small. Sarah adapted. Park didn't. Rodriguez quit before we could gather data. Three test pilots isn't enough for statistical significance."

Marcus followed her to the medical bay. The neural scanner hummed as it mapped his brain structure. The process took two hours—every synapse, every neural pathway documented in exquisite detail.

"Your hippocampus shows interesting structure," Emma said, studying the results. "More plasticity markers than average. Your brain might be good at forming new pathways under stress."

"Is that good for FTL jumps?"

"Unknown. Sarah's brain restructured itself extensively. High neural plasticity might allow adaptation. Or might make fragmentation worse. We don't have enough data."

"So I'm still rolling dice."

"Everyone is. But maybe your dice are weighted slightly better."

The tests continued. Temporal perception assessments. Reaction time under simulated field exposure. Psychological evaluations that tried to measure resilience to causality violation.

Marcus scored well. Not perfectly. But well enough that Dr. Mbara cleared him for jump operations.

"Your first jump is scheduled for next week," she said. "We've implemented improved shielding protocols based on Sarah's experience. Neural monitoring throughout the transition. Real-time field adjustments if we detect fragmentation onset."

"What are my odds?"

"Of completing the jump successfully? Ninety-five percent. Of experiencing some degree of temporal perception shift? Seventy percent. Of catastrophic fragmentation requiring life support? Fifteen percent."

"Those are terrible odds for the last one."

"Those are the best odds we can give. FTL travel violates causality. Your neurons will experience time non-linearly during field transition. Some degree of adaptation is required. The question is whether your brain can adapt without fragmenting."

Marcus thought about Sarah's letter. About existing across all moments simultaneously. About losing linear causality and gaining temporal omniscience.

Was that adaptation or destruction?

"I want to talk to Lieutenant Chen before the jump."

Aisha nodded. "I'll arrange it. She's expressed interest in meeting the volunteers. Answering questions. Providing perspective that medical data can't capture."

The meeting happened three days later. Sarah sat in her three-meter cage, the selective field generator humming its complex song. She looked thinner than her service photos. Her eyes had that distant quality—seeing multiple moments simultaneously.

"Lieutenant Webb. Sit down." Sarah gestured to a chair positioned at the field's edge. "You read my letter."

"Three times. It was... comprehensive."

"It was honest. I won't sugarcoat temporal fragmentation to make recruitment easier." She studied him with those impossible eyes. "Why are you still volunteering?"

"Because someone has to. Because FTL travel matters. Because—" Marcus paused. "Because you survived. If one person can adapt, others can too."

"I survived by becoming something that isn't entirely human anymore. I experience all moments equally. Past and future are as real as present. My consciousness exists across incompatible timeframes." Sarah leaned forward. "Is that success or failure?"

"You're alive. Contributing. Helping solve the problems your jumps revealed. That's success."

"I'm trapped in a three-meter field radius. Dependent on exotic physics to maintain cellular coherence. Unable to experience time the way humans evolved to experience it." She smiled. It flickered across multiple expressions. "But yes. I'm alive. And I consider that success."

"What should I expect? From the first jump?"

"Disorientation. Your neurons will experience microseconds at different rates. Your brain will try to maintain linear consciousness while living through temporal paradox. Most people adapt within hours. Some never adapt." Sarah pulled up neural imaging. "Park's brain tried to maintain absolute linearity. The contradiction destroyed his hippocampus. My brain accepted temporal variance and restructured to accommodate it. Two different responses to the same stimulus."

"How do I ensure my brain chooses your response instead of Park's?"

"You can't. Neural adaptation isn't voluntary. Your brain will do what it does. You just experience the results." Sarah met his eyes. "But you can prepare psychologically. Accept that causality is flexible. Don't fight the temporal variance. Let your neurons find new pathways instead of forcing them into old patterns."

"That sounds like meditation advice."

"It's neuroscience advice that resembles meditation. Fighting temporal fragmentation makes it worse. Accepting it allows adaptation." She pulled up her own brain scans. "Every jump made me more temporally aware. I could have fought that. Tried to stay linear. I would have ended up like Park. Instead, I adapted. Became something new."

Marcus studied the scans. Sarah's brain showed structures that didn't exist in normal human neurology. Temporal processing centers. Neural pathways connecting past-perception to future-prediction. A consciousness architected for non-linear causality.

"Do you regret it?"

Sarah was quiet. Experiencing his question across multiple timeframes. Regret in the past. Acceptance in the present. Pride in the future.

"I regret what it cost. My freedom, my linear experience of time, my ability to exist normally. But I don't regret volunteering. Humanity needed FTL. I helped achieve it. That matters more than my personal comfort."

"Even if the cost is permanent?"

"The cost is already permanent. I'll exist across all moments for the rest of my life. However long that is. But the gain is permanent too. Humanity will reach the stars. Colonize distant worlds. Expand beyond Earth. I contributed to that." She smiled. Past, present, future smiles overlapping. "Worth it, on balance."

Marcus left the meeting feeling simultaneously terrified and determined. Sarah had paid brutal costs. But she'd succeeded. Adapted. Survived.

If she could do it, maybe he could too.

The week passed in preparation. Final medical scans. Neural baseline documentation. Psychological evaluations. Everything recorded so that if he fragmented, future researchers could understand why.

The night before his first jump, Marcus couldn't sleep. He lay in his quarters thinking about temporal paradox. About experiencing moments non-linearly. About his brain restructuring to accommodate impossible physics.

Sarah's words echoed: "Don't fight the temporal variance. Let your neurons find new pathways."

Advice that sounded simple. Execution that would determine whether he adapted or collapsed.

Morning came. Marcus dressed in the jump suit, reported to the hangar. The jump ship waited, sleek and deadly. A vessel designed to break causality.

Dr. Kenji Yamamoto ran final checks. "Neural monitoring active. Shielding protocols engaged. We'll be watching every synapse during transition. Any sign of catastrophic fragmentation, we abort immediately."

"And if you can't abort in time?"

"Then we do our best with what remains." Kenji's expression was serious. "Lieutenant Webb, you can still withdraw. No judgment. No consequences."

Marcus thought about Sarah in her three-meter cage. About Park in his coma. About Rodriguez who'd chosen psychological discharge over continued jumps.

About humanity reaching for the stars.

"I'm going."

"Then good luck. And remember Sarah's advice—don't fight the temporal effects. Let your brain adapt."

Marcus strapped into the cockpit. The neural monitors attached to his skull felt intrusive. The jump ship's systems came online, exotic matter generators spinning up.

This was it. The moment where he'd either adapt to temporal paradox or fragment trying.

The countdown began.

Marcus closed his eyes and tried to accept that causality was about to become negotiable.

His brain would either find new pathways or break trying to maintain old ones.

Time would tell.

Assuming time could still be trusted.

Assuming anything could.
