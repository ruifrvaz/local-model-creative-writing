Lieutenant Yuki Tanaka felt the pregnancy test results across three different timeframes simultaneously. Positive now. Had been positive yesterday. Would be confirmed by medical scan tomorrow.

All equally real. All already determined. All waiting to collapse into singular experience.

She sat in the medical bay and tried to process what temporal consciousness made simple: She was pregnant. Her daughter would be temporally aware. The future Sarah had predicted was manifesting.

Dr. Aisha Mbara reviewed the scan results. "Twelve weeks. Healthy development. Genetic markers suggest the fetus carries your neuroplasticity genes."

"Will she adapt to temporal consciousness naturally? Without FTL exposure?"

"Unknown. You developed temporal awareness through Alcubierre field exposure. Your daughter is developing in a womb that exists partially in non-linear time. The neurological effects are unpredictable."

Yuki pulled up her own temporal perception data. She experienced moments with mild temporal variance—could sense probability waves, occasionally perceived near-future events. Nothing like Sarah's complete temporal omniscience.

But her daughter was developing inside a body that existed across temporal states. Forming neural structures in an environment where causality was negotiable.

"What if she's born with full temporal consciousness? Experiencing all moments from birth?"

"Then we adapt our child-rearing protocols. Develop educational frameworks for temporally-aware infants." Aisha pulled up theoretical models. "Dr. Emma Torres has been preparing for this possibility since Sarah's prediction. We have preliminary developmental guidelines."

"Guidelines for raising a child who experiences past, present, future simultaneously? That seems optimistic."

"We're improvising. Same as everything else in FTL research."

Yuki thought about her daughter. About explaining linear time to someone who'd never experienced it. About teaching cause-and-effect to a consciousness that perceived effects before causes.

"I want to continue jump operations."

Aisha looked up sharply. "You're pregnant. FTL exposure during gestation could have unknown effects."

"I'm already temporally adapted. My daughter is developing in that context. Continuing jumps maintains environmental consistency."

"Or accelerates her temporal adaptation beyond sustainable levels."

"Sarah experienced all her pregnancies across multiple timeframes." Yuki paused. "Wait, Sarah isn't pregnant. Why did I say pregnancies plural?"

"Because you're experiencing probability waves. In some futures, Sarah has children. You're perceiving those timelines bleeding into present awareness."

Yuki felt her temporal perception sharpen. Multiple futures overlapping. In some, she continued jumping throughout pregnancy. In others, she grounded herself for nine months. Different choices leading to different outcomes.

"What does Sarah recommend?"

They found Sarah in her three-meter cage, experiencing all moments while reading quantum field equations. She looked up before they spoke.

"You want to know if continuing jump operations during pregnancy is safe."

"You've seen the outcomes?"

"I've seen probable outcomes. Sixty-three percent of timelines where you continue jumping, your daughter develops enhanced temporal awareness. Thirty-seven percent, she develops normally." Sarah pulled up probability distributions. "If you ground yourself, fifty-two percent she develops normally, forty-eight percent she still shows temporal adaptation from gestational exposure."

"So either way, she's likely to be temporally aware?"

"She's developing inside your body. Your neural structures are partially temporal. Your cellular biology exists across time states. She's been exposed since conception." Sarah met Yuki's eyes across timeframes. "The question isn't whether she'll be temporal. It's how deeply adapted she'll become."

Yuki felt the weight of that. Her daughter would never experience linear time normally. Would never live in the present without awareness of past and future bleeding through.

"Is that fair to her? Imposing temporal consciousness without choice?"

"Was it fair that you were born with neuroplasticity genes predisposing you to FTL adaptation? We don't choose our genetics. We choose what we do with them." Sarah pulled up developmental projections. "Your daughter will experience reality differently than linear humans. But different isn't worse. Just different."

"You exist in a three-meter cage."

"Because my temporal adaptation progressed catastrophically. Your daughter won't have that trajectory. She'll develop with temporal awareness as normal. Adapt from birth instead of restructuring adult neurology."

"You're saying she'll be better adapted than you?"

"I'm saying she'll be native to temporal consciousness. You and I are immigrants. She'll be indigenous." Sarah smiled across moments. "The first of many. Within twenty years, temporal births will outnumber adapted adults. Within fifty, temporal humans will be the majority FTL pilot population."

Aisha pulled up the projections. "You're talking about speciation. A subspecies born temporally aware."

"I'm talking about evolution accelerated by technology. Same thing that happened with every human advancement. Fire. Agriculture. Industrialization. Now FTL travel. Each change transforms humanity's baseline capabilities."

Yuki thought about that. About her daughter as prototype for new humanity. About evolution happening in real-time instead of across millennia.

"I'll continue jump operations. Controlled exposure. Monitored carefully. If we're going to have temporal children, we need data on gestational development."

"I'll set up continuous monitoring," Aisha said. "Neural scans of fetal development. Temporal perception testing as early as possible. This is unprecedented."

The pregnancy proceeded with weekly jump operations. Yuki's temporal awareness remained stable. Her daughter's neural development showed unusual patterns—temporal processing structures forming earlier than normal hippocampal development.

At twenty weeks, fetal neural activity suggested awareness. At twenty-four weeks, the fetus showed response patterns consistent with temporal perception. At twenty-eight weeks, Dr. Torres detected what looked like future-probability sensing.

"Your daughter is aware," Emma told Yuki during a routine scan. "Conscious in a way we've never measured in fetal development. And she's perceiving time non-linearly already."

Yuki felt her daughter's presence across multiple moments. Past kicks. Present movement. Future birth. All accessible simultaneously.

"Can she communicate?"

"Not verbally. But her neural patterns suggest she's aware of your temporal consciousness. Might be synchronizing with your perception."

Mother and daughter existing across temporal states together. Two consciousnesses experiencing non-linear time, one inside the other.

The intimacy was profound. Yuki felt her daughter's awareness brush against hers. Felt futures where they'd communicate across moments. Felt the probability of healthy birth solidify from wave function into certainty.

"She's going to be fine," Yuki said. Certainty replacing anxiety.

"You've seen her future?"

"I've felt her presence in it. She exists in timelines extending decades ahead. Happy, healthy, adapted. The first native temporal consciousness."

Birth came at thirty-nine weeks. Yuki experienced labor across multiple timeframes—pain that had happened and was happening and would happen all simultaneously. Her daughter emerged crying in three different temporal states.

Dr. Mbara caught the infant and ran immediate neurological scans. "Neural activity consistent with temporal consciousness. She's perceiving non-linearly from birth."

They named her Akari. Light in multiple meanings—photons, enlightenment, hope.

Akari opened eyes that seemed to see past, present, future simultaneously. Her newborn awareness touched her mother's temporal consciousness. Two minds existing across moments, experiencing the same non-linear reality.

"Hello, little one," Yuki whispered. "Welcome to all moments at once."

Sarah visited the maternity ward. Stood at the doorway of her three-meter cage while Yuki held Akari in a temporal field generator designed for infants.

"The first," Sarah said. "But not the last. Within my lifetime—experienced across all moments—there will be millions like her. Temporal humans. Native to FTL consciousness."

"What kind of future are we creating?"

"Different. Strange. Beautiful in ways linear humans can't fully grasp." Sarah watched Akari experiencing multiple moments simultaneously. "She'll never know the simplicity of linear time. But she'll know the richness of probability. The depth of experiencing all causality at once."

"Is that better?"

"It's evolution. Better and worse don't apply. Only different."

Akari grew. At six months, she showed temporal perception equivalent to adult adapted pilots. At one year, she could communicate across probable timelines. At two years, her temporal awareness exceeded Sarah's—native capability surpassing adapted restructuring.

She was the prototype. The first human born temporally aware. The first of a new subspecies adapted for faster-than-light consciousness.

And she was happy. Existed joyfully across all moments. Experienced causality as rich possibility instead of linear constraint.

Yuki watched her daughter play—in past, present, future simultaneously—and felt certainty.

This was humanity's evolution. Strange. Unprecedented. Irreversible.

But beautiful.

In its way.

Across all moments.

Forever.
