Dr. Eva Sato stood in the archive chamber, surrounded by two centuries of human history.

Digital records. Physical artifacts. Cultural preservation from Earth. The accumulated knowledge and memory of a civilization traveling between stars.

Her responsibility. Her burden.

She pulled up the mission charter. The document that started it all. Eight thousand people volunteered. Signed oaths. Committed their descendants to a four-hundred-year journey.

And now, with a single vote, that commitment was void.

"You're brooding." Captain Ana Reyes appeared at the entrance.

"I'm preserving context for future generations. They should know what we gave up."

Ana moved to the display showing the vote results. "We gave up certainty for survival."

"We gave up purpose for convenience." Eva highlighted the genetic analysis. "Okoye's models assume worst-case scenarios. We might have been fine."

"Might have. Or might have arrived at Tau Ceti as a genetically compromised population unable to establish sustainable settlement." Ana pulled up alternative projections. "The risk was real, Eva."

"So was the mission." Eva turned from the archives. "Do you know how many people died building this ship? How many families sacrificed everything so their descendants could reach Tau Ceti?"

"I know. I studied the same history you did."

"Then how can you accept abandonment?"

Ana was quiet. Then: "Because I'm responsible for the living, not the dead. And the living voted for survival."

"By six hundred votes. Hardly a mandate."

"Enough of a mandate that we're committed." Ana's expression softened. "Eva, I understand your position. The mission was sacred. But maybe sacred isn't the same as right."

Eva wanted to argue. Wanted to defend the mission's purity. But she was tired. Two hundred years of preserved culture weighed on her. The responsibility of remembering when everyone else seemed eager to forget.

"What happens to the ship?" she asked. "After we land?"

"Salvage. Most of it. We'll need the materials for surface construction." Ana pulled up the engineering plans. "But we'll preserve the archive. The historical sections. The cultural artifacts. They'll become museums on the new world."

"Museums of a failed mission."

"Museums of an evolved mission. We didn't fail, Eva. We adapted."

The distinction felt hollow. But Eva was outvoted. Outnumbered. Out of options.

"I want to lead the historical preservation team," she said. "Make sure we document this properly."

"Granted. You'll work with Malik on identifying which sections to preserve intact."

Ana left. Eva returned to the archives, pulling up records from the Endurance's launch.

Video of the original crew. Faces full of hope and determination. Speeches about humanity's future among the stars. Oaths taken freely, binding descendants across centuries.

She watched her great-great-grandmother take that oath. Watched her commit every future generation to reaching Tau Ceti.

And now Eva would be the one to break that promise.

She drafted a historical record. Careful. Objective. Documenting the vote and the reasons behind it.

But she also added a personal note. A dissent. An acknowledgment that some believed the mission should have continued.

Future generations would judge. They'd have all the data. All the context.

Eva could only preserve the truth and trust history to be fair.

Even when the present wasn't.

The following weeks were chaos.

Deceleration burns created persistent vibration through the ship. Engineering teams worked around the clock converting modules into landing craft. Medical prepared for planetary diseases. Agricultural planned the first surface crops.

And through it all, tension between those who supported the decision and those who opposed it.

Eva watched the divide grow. Traditionalists marked themselves with badges showing Tau Ceti's coordinates. Settlers wore planet imagery. Small symbols of massive disagreement.

She tried to bridge the gap. Hosted forums. Encouraged dialogue. Reminded everyone they were still one colony, regardless of destination.

But some wounds ran deeper than reason.

She found graffiti in the lower decks. "Betrayers." "Oath-breakers." "Lost mission."

Messages from people who felt abandoned by their own community.

Eva documented it all. The anger. The division. The cost of democratic decision-making when the margin was narrow.

One month into deceleration, the first act of sabotage occurred.

Someone cut power to the agricultural bays. Twenty percent of the food crops died before backup systems engaged.

Security identified the saboteur. A young traditionalist who believed stopping the mission was worth any cost.

Captain Reyes held a public tribunal. The saboteur was unrepentant.

"You're killing the mission our ancestors died for. I won't be complicit."

"You endangered eight thousand lives," Ana replied. "Including people who agree with you philosophically. That's not principled opposition. That's terrorism."

The saboteur was sentenced to confinement. The message was clear: dissent was acceptable. Violence wasn't.

But Eva saw the calculation in other traditionalists' eyes. The saboteur had become a martyr. A symbol.

The division was deepening.

She requested a meeting with Ana.

"We need to address this before landing," Eva said. "We can't build a new society while half the population resents the foundation."

"I'm open to suggestions."

Eva pulled up a proposal she'd been developing. "Give the traditionalists an option. Once we're settled and stable, we build a second ship. A smaller one. They can continue to Tau Ceti."

"With what resources? We'll need everything for planetary settlement."

"We won't need the Endurance's fusion reactors once we're planetside. We can repurpose one. Build a vessel capable of completing the original mission."

Ana studied the proposal. "This would take years. Maybe decades."

"But it gives the traditionalists hope. Purpose. A reason to cooperate with settlement even if they don't agree with it."

"Or it divides the colony permanently. Two populations. Two futures."

"We're already divided. This just acknowledges reality." Eva highlighted the sabotage report. "And it prevents more violence."

Ana was quiet for a long time. Then she nodded. "I'll present it to the council. But Eva, if this passes, you realize what it means?"

"That we're not one colony anymore. We're two."

"Exactly. And history will judge whether that was wisdom or weakness."

Eva thought about her great-great-grandmother. About the oaths taken and the promises made. About the weight of inherited purpose and the necessity of adaptation.

"History will judge many things about this moment," she said. "We can only control what we do. Not how it's remembered."

Ana smiled sadly. "That's very philosophical."

"That's very historian."

The proposal went to a vote. This time, the margin was wider.

5,847 in favor. 2,153 opposed.

The colony would split. The majority would settle the planet. The traditionalists would continue the original mission once resources allowed.

Two futures. One ship.

Eva documented it all. The debates. The compromises. The painful acknowledgment that some purposes could only be honored through division.

She didn't know if it was the right choice. Didn't know if future generations would celebrate or condemn.

She only knew it was the choice they'd made.

And in three months, when the Endurance entered orbit around an unnamed world, both futures would begin.

Different paths. Same legacy.

The mission changed. But it didn't end.

It just became something else. Something new.

And Eva would preserve that story, whatever it became.
