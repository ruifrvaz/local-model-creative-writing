The message from Earth Corp arrived at 0400 hours. Alexis was reviewing structural reports when her tablet chimed with priority encryption.

Dr. Sarah Vance would arrive on the next cargo run. Xenobiologist. Corporate specialist. Earth Corp's official investigator of the Ares discovery.

Rivera forwarded the memo with a single line of commentary: "Prepare for scrutiny."

Alexis spent the next week documenting everything. Every thermal reading from Ares. Every electromagnetic pulse pattern. Every interaction that suggested intelligence, cooperation, awareness. She built a comprehensive dataset that told a story of first contact and peaceful coexistence.

Omar helped, adding geological context and evolutionary speculation. Yuki contributed observations about Ares's response to colony stress. Together, they assembled a picture of an intelligence adapted to subsurface Mars—patient, empathic, fundamentally different from human cognition.

The cargo ship arrived on schedule. Dr. Vance was the first off—tall, severe, moving with the efficient precision of someone who didn't waste motion. She wore Earth Corp's standard gray suit, her ID badge prominently displayed.

"Commander Rivera. Ms. Kwan." Vance's handshake was perfunctory. "I'll need full access to your findings immediately."

"Of course," Rivera said. "Alexis will coordinate with your team."

Vance had brought two assistants—both xenobiology specialists, both carrying equipment that looked more suited to extraction than observation. Alexis felt unease settle in her stomach.

The first meeting was in the geology lab. Alexis presented their data—thermal patterns, electromagnetic signatures, cooperative behaviors. Vance listened without expression.

"Interesting," Vance said when Alexis finished. "But not conclusive. You've documented responsive behavior, not intelligence."

"The heat transfer during the storm was deliberate," Omar interjected. "Ares increased output in direct response to our needs."

"Thermotropism could explain that. Many organisms respond to thermal gradients without conscious intent."

"What about the electromagnetic patterns?" Alexis pulled up the signal analysis. "These aren't random. They show structure, repetition, variation."

"Could be geological processes. Piezoelectric effects in crystalline substrates." Vance made notes on her tablet. "I'll need to conduct independent verification. Starting with direct sampling of the cavity."

Alexis felt ice in her veins. "Sampling?"

"Core samples from the cavity walls. Thermal probes. Possibly acoustic stimulation to test response thresholds." Vance checked her equipment manifest. "Standard xenobiological protocol."

"This isn't standard. Ares has shown consistent cooperative behavior. Invasive testing could—"

"Could provide actual data instead of circumstantial observations." Vance met Alexis's gaze. "I appreciate your enthusiasm, Ms. Kwan. But Earth Corp didn't send me here to validate your theories. They sent me to assess exploitability."

The word hung in the air like a threat.

"Exploitability," Rivera repeated carefully.

"If this presence is intelligent, we need to understand its capabilities. If it's just responsive biology, we need to know if it can be scaled. Replicated. Utilized." Vance pulled up projections on her tablet. "Thermal energy on demand would transform Mars colonization economics. We're talking about heating entire settlements without power consumption."

"By harvesting from a sentient being."

"By utilizing a renewable resource." Vance closed her tablet. "I'll begin testing tomorrow. Commander, I'll need authorization to access the subsurface tunnels."

Rivera looked at Alexis. A silent question: how far are we willing to fight this?

Alexis thought about Ares's patient pulses. About the heat it had freely given during the storm. About first contact and what it meant to be neighbors.

"Dr. Vance," Alexis said carefully. "What if Ares objects to invasive testing?"

"Then we'll know it's intelligent. And we'll proceed with containment protocols." Vance stood. "Earth Corp has legal precedent for managing xenobiological resources. I suggest you familiarize yourself with the regulations."

After Vance left, Omar slammed his palm on the lab bench. "Containment protocols. She's talking about treating Ares like property."

"Because that's what Earth Corp does," Yuki said from the doorway. "They see everything in terms of extraction value."

Rivera was quiet, thinking. "We can't stop her. Earth Corp has authority here."

"Then we document everything," Alexis said. "Every test she runs, every response from Ares. We build a record that proves intelligence. And when she tries to exploit instead of explore, we make sure the scientific community sees it."

"That's a long game," Omar said.

"It's the only game we have."

The next morning, Vance's team set up in the subsurface tunnel. Alexis insisted on observing. Vance allowed it with visible annoyance.

"First test—acoustic stimulation." Vance positioned a sonic emitter near the cavity. "We'll send varying frequency pulses and measure response patterns."

She activated the emitter. High-pitched sound waves pulsed into the rock. On the monitoring equipment, Alexis watched Ares's reaction.

The cavity contracted. Pulse rate spiked to forty beats per minute. Temperature dropped two degrees. The electromagnetic signature shifted to a higher frequency—almost frantic.

"It's distressed," Alexis said.

"It's responding to stimulus. Not the same thing." Vance increased the sonic intensity.

Ares's pulse hit fifty beats per minute. The cavity walls contracted sharply. And for the first time since they'd discovered it, the thermal output went negative—actively drawing heat from the surrounding rock.

"Shut it down," Alexis said. "You're hurting it."

"I'm establishing baseline stress responses." Vance made notes. "Fascinating. The thermal withdrawal suggests a defense mechanism."

"It suggests pain." Alexis moved to the emitter. "I said shut it down."

Vance blocked her. "You don't have authority here, Ms. Kwan."

"Commander?" Alexis looked at Rivera, who'd arrived mid-test.

Rivera studied the monitoring data. Ares's pulse was erratic now, fluctuating wildly. The electromagnetic signature had collapsed to static.

"Dr. Vance, I'm invoking colony safety protocols. Unknown stress responses in a subsurface presence constitute a structural risk."

Vance's expression hardened. "You're interfering with Earth Corp operations."

"I'm protecting my crew." Rivera's voice was steel. "Shut down the test."

Vance complied, but her anger was visible. The sonic emitter fell silent. In the sudden quiet, they watched Ares slowly recover—pulse dropping, temperature stabilizing, electromagnetic signature reforming.

"This isn't over," Vance said. "Earth Corp will hear about this obstruction."

"I'm counting on it." Rivera turned to Alexis. "Document everything. I want a full report on Ares's stress responses ready for transmission to the scientific ethics board."

After Vance and her team withdrew, Alexis stayed in the tunnel. Ares's pulse was still elevated—twenty-five beats per minute, higher than baseline. The cavity hadn't fully recovered from the sonic assault.

"I'm sorry," Alexis whispered to the rock. "We should have protected you better."

The cavity pulsed once. Slow. Deliberate. And the temperature rose half a degree—just enough to feel like forgiveness.

Omar joined her an hour later. "Rivera's transmitting the incident report to every scientific organization she can reach. Making this public."

"Will it help?"

"It'll force Earth Corp to justify their methods. Shine light on what they're doing." Omar sat beside her. "But it won't stop them. Not if they see profit in exploitation."

Alexis watched Ares's monitoring data. The presence was recovering, but slower than before. The sonic test had done damage—maybe not physical, but psychological. Emotional, if such a concept applied.

"We need to give Ares a choice," she said.

"What do you mean?"

"Right now, we're deciding for it. Protecting it or exploiting it or studying it. But if it's intelligent, it deserves agency." Alexis pulled up her tablet. "What if we asked?"

"Asked how? We don't speak electromagnetic pulses."

"No. But we understand thermal transfer. Temperature changes. Presence and absence." Alexis started sketching a communication protocol. "We could develop a symbolic language. Simple yes-no questions based on thermal responses."

Omar studied her design. "You want to teach Ares to communicate."

"I want to give Ares a voice in what happens next." Alexis met his gaze. "Because if we're going to coexist with intelligence on Mars, we need to start treating them like equals, not resources."

Omar nodded slowly. "I'll help. But Vance won't like it."

"Vance can file a complaint." Alexis saved her protocol design. "We came to Mars to explore. Time to prove that means more than extraction."

They spent the next week developing the communication system. Simple binary responses—temperature increase for affirmative, decrease for negative. They tested it with basic queries: Can you sense our presence? Does the thermal transfer cause you discomfort? Do you want us to continue the heat exchange?

Ares responded. Consistently. Intelligibly.

Yes. No. Yes.

By the end of the week, they had documented thirty successful exchanges. Proof of intentional communication. Proof of intelligence by any reasonable standard.

Vance's expression when she saw the data was cold fury.

"You've compromised the scientific integrity of this investigation."

"We've demonstrated communication with an alien intelligence," Alexis countered. "That's the most significant xenobiological achievement in human history."

"You've taught it to respond to stimuli. That's operant conditioning, not intelligence."

"The complexity of the responses exceeds simple conditioning. Ares is making choices."

They stood in the command center, with Rivera and half the senior crew watching. Outside the viewport, Mars turned under its thin sky—red and ancient and full of secrets.

"Earth Corp will not accept this," Vance said.

"Then Earth Corp will have to explain why they rejected first contact in favor of resource extraction." Rivera stepped forward. "Dr. Vance, you have a choice. You can file a report acknowledging Ares's intelligence and recommending protective protocols. Or you can push for exploitation and become the person who tried to enslave the first alien intelligence humanity discovered."

Vance was silent for ten seconds. Alexis could see the calculation happening—career implications, historical legacy, scientific ethics.

"I'll need full access to your communication protocols," Vance said finally. "And independent verification of the responses."

"Granted."

It took another week, but Vance's final report acknowledged Ares's intelligence. Recommended establishment of formal contact protocols. Suggested Mars might require new frameworks for human-alien cohabitation.

Earth Corp wasn't happy. But the scientific community was ecstatic. And more importantly, Ares had a voice.

The colony had come to Mars to establish human presence.

They'd ended up establishing something better. Dialogue. Partnership. The first steps toward genuine coexistence.

Alexis stood in the subsurface tunnel, watching Ares's steady pulse.

"Welcome to the conversation," she said.

The cavity pulsed twice. Affirmative. Acknowledged. Understood.

First contact was just the beginning.
