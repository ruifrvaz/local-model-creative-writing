The bridge doors hissed open before Elena reached them. Marcus stood at the sensor array, his shoulders rigid.

"Show me." She crossed the deck in four strides, her cybernetic arm already reaching for the console controls.

The holographic display flickered to life. Radiation signatures danced across the quantum foam—patterns that shouldn't exist this far from any stellar body. Her pulse quickened. She'd seen readings like this once before. On Phobos.

"It's moving," Marcus said, his voice tight. "Whatever it is, it's tracking us."

Elena pulled up the ship's defensive grid. The neural interface synced with her implants, and suddenly she could feel the Meridian's hull like her own skin. Every sensor was an extension of her awareness. The anomaly pulsed in her mind—cold, vast, patient.

"Wake the crew," she said. "All hands to stations."

Marcus hesitated. "Captain, if we—"

"Now, Commander."

He moved to comply, but his expression told her everything. They both knew what came next. The Phobos incident had ended with three hundred dead and a quarantine zone that would last a century. And this signature was stronger.

Elena allowed herself one deep breath. Then she activated the shipwide comm.

"This is Captain Reeves. We have a situation."

The response was immediate. Stations lit up across her tactical display as crew members reported in. Engineering, medical, weapons control—every department acknowledged within thirty seconds. Her crew was good. Disciplined. They'd drilled for this scenario a hundred times.

But drills didn't account for the weight in her chest when she looked at the anomaly's energy output. Numbers that defied physics. A gravity well that shouldn't exist. Quantum fluctuations that suggested the thing wasn't entirely in their dimensional space.

"Captain," Lieutenant Patel called from the science station. "I'm getting interference in the sensor grid. The anomaly is emitting some kind of field that's degrading our resolution."

"Switch to backup arrays."

"Already done. It's adapting. Whatever that field is, it's learning our sensor frequencies."

Elena felt her implants tingle—a warning from the ship's AI that their defensive posture was being analyzed. The anomaly wasn't just tracking them. It was studying them.

"Marcus, bring the weapons grid online. Safeties enabled, but I want full charge on the main batteries."

"Aye, Captain."

The bridge hummed with activity. Elena watched her crew work, each person focused on their task. Rodriguez at navigation, Chen monitoring power distribution, Reyes at tactical. They trusted her. They'd followed her into deep space on a mission that Fleet Command had classified above top secret.

She couldn't let them down the way she'd failed Phobos.

"Distance to contact?" Elena asked.

"Three million klicks and closing," Reyes reported. "Current velocity suggests intercept in forty-seven minutes."

Forty-seven minutes to decide whether to run, fight, or try something humanity had never attempted before. First contact with an intelligence that existed outside normal spacetime.

Elena pulled up the classified files on her personal terminal. Project Threshold. The real reason they were out here. Fleet suspected the Phobos anomaly wasn't unique—that there were others, scattered across the galaxy. Watchers. Guardians. Or predators.

The Meridian's mission was to find one and make contact.

Looks like they'd succeeded.

"Captain," Marcus said quietly, moving to her side. "Your orders?"

Elena looked at the anomaly. At her crew. At the readiness indicators that showed her ship was as prepared as it could be for the unknown.

"We hold position," she said. "And we wait."

"Wait for what?"

"To see what it wants." Elena locked eyes with her first officer. "We came out here to find answers. Running won't give us those."

Marcus nodded slowly. "Fleet will have our heads if this goes wrong."

"Let them try." Elena turned back to the display. "I didn't survive Phobos just to hide from shadows."

The anomaly pulsed, and somewhere deep in her neural implants, Elena thought she heard something like a whisper.

The universe was speaking.

It was time to listen.
