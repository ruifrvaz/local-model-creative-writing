The bridge doors hissed open before Elena reached them. Marcus stood at the sensor array, his shoulders rigid.

"Show me." She crossed the deck in four strides, her cybernetic arm already reaching for the console controls.

The holographic display flickered to life. Radiation signatures danced across the quantum foam—patterns that shouldn't exist this far from any stellar body. Her pulse quickened. She'd seen readings like this once before. On Phobos.

"It's moving," Marcus said, his voice tight. "Whatever it is, it's tracking us."

Elena pulled up the ship's defensive grid. The neural interface synced with her implants, and suddenly she could feel the Meridian's hull like her own skin. Every sensor was an extension of her awareness. The anomaly pulsed in her mind—cold, vast, patient.

"Wake the crew," she said. "All hands to stations."

Marcus hesitated. "Captain, if we—"

"Now, Commander."

He moved to comply, but his expression told her everything. They both knew what came next. The Phobos incident had ended with three hundred dead and a quarantine zone that would last a century. And this signature was stronger.

Elena allowed herself one deep breath. Then she activated the shipwide comm.

"This is Captain Reeves. We have a situation."
