The tactical briefing room was designed for six people. Elena had crammed in twelve.

"Status reports," she said, standing at the head of the table. The holographic display behind her showed the Meridian's position—a lonely dot in the vast dark between Saturn and Uranus.

Marcus went first. "All crew accounted for. We're on rotating watch schedules. Morale is... steady."

That meant scared but professional. Elena made a note.

Chen spoke next. "Engineering's making progress. We're at sixty-five percent reactor output. Jump drive's still offline, but I've got the railguns back online. Two shots before we blow the grid."

"Sensors?" Elena looked at Lieutenant Reyes.

"The anomaly's maintaining distance. Three hundred thousand klicks and holding." Reyes pulled up a tracking plot. "It's matching our course corrections. Every time we turn, it adjusts."

"Weapons status?"

"Point defense is green. Railguns operational but limited. Missile tubes are loaded." Reyes paused. "Captain, against an unknown target, I can't guarantee effectiveness."

"Noted." Elena turned to Patel. "What have we learned about our friend out there?"

Patel activated a new display. "It's approximately eight hundred meters in diameter. No conventional propulsion signature. It's just... there. Moving with us."

"Can we communicate?"

"We've tried every frequency, every protocol. No response." He brought up spectral data. "But it's definitely transmitting something. Low-frequency pulses. Could be communication, could be scanning, could be a countdown."

Someone laughed nervously. Elena didn't acknowledge it.

"Recommendations?"

Marcus leaned forward. "We can't fight it. We can't outrun it. That leaves negotiation or evasion."

"We've tried negotiation," Patel said. "It's not listening."

"Then we stop running." Elena let that sink in. "We've been reacting since this started. It's time to take initiative."

"Captain?" Reyes looked uncertain.

"We have one advantage—we're human. We're unpredictable." Elena gestured at the display. "This thing has been following us, studying us. Let's give it something to study."

"You want to provoke it," Marcus said.

"I want to learn what it wants. And the only way to do that is to change the variables." Elena pulled up a tactical plot. "Chen, can you give me a controlled reactor spike?"

"How controlled?"

"Enough to look like a malfunction. Not enough to actually blow us up."

Chen considered. "Risky, but doable."

"Reyes, I want a firing solution on that thing. Don't shoot unless I give the word, but make it obvious we're targeting it."

"Aye, Captain."

Elena looked around the table. Scared faces, but determined. Good.

"We make our move in six hours. Until then, battle stations. And people?" She met each person's eyes in turn. "If this goes wrong, remember we tried peace first."

The room emptied quickly. Only Marcus remained.

"Risky play," he said.

"It's all we've got." Elena stared at the anomaly on the display. Patient. Watching. Waiting.

"And if it doesn't work?"

She didn't answer. They both knew what came next.
