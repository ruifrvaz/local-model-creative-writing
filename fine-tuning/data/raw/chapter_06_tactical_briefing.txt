The tactical briefing room was designed for six people. Elena had crammed in twelve.

"Status reports," she said, standing at the head of the table. The holographic display behind her showed the Meridian's position—a lonely dot in the vast dark between Saturn and Uranus.

Marcus went first. "All crew accounted for. We're on rotating watch schedules. Morale is... steady."

That meant scared but professional. Elena made a note.

Chen spoke next. "Engineering's making progress. We're at sixty-five percent reactor output. Jump drive's still offline, but I've got the railguns back online. Two shots before we blow the grid."

"Sensors?" Elena looked at Lieutenant Reyes.

"The anomaly's maintaining distance. Three hundred thousand klicks and holding." Reyes pulled up a tracking plot. "It's matching our course corrections. Every time we turn, it adjusts."

"Weapons status?"

"Point defense is green. Railguns operational but limited. Missile tubes are loaded." Reyes paused. "Captain, against an unknown target, I can't guarantee effectiveness."

"Noted." Elena turned to Patel. "What have we learned about our friend out there?"

Patel activated a new display. "It's approximately eight hundred meters in diameter. No conventional propulsion signature. It's just... there. Moving with us."

"Can we communicate?"

"We've tried every frequency, every protocol. No response." He brought up spectral data. "But it's definitely transmitting something. Low-frequency pulses. Could be communication, could be scanning, could be a countdown."

Someone laughed nervously. Elena didn't acknowledge it.

"Recommendations?"

Marcus leaned forward. "We can't fight it. We can't outrun it. That leaves negotiation or evasion."

"We've tried negotiation," Patel said. "It's not listening."

"Then we stop running." Elena let that sink in. "We've been reacting since this started. It's time to take initiative."

"Captain?" Reyes looked uncertain.

"We have one advantage—we're human. We're unpredictable." Elena gestured at the display. "This thing has been following us, studying us. Let's give it something to study."

"You want to provoke it," Marcus said.

"I want to learn what it wants. And the only way to do that is to change the variables." Elena pulled up a tactical plot. "Chen, can you give me a controlled reactor spike?"

"How controlled?"

"Enough to look like a malfunction. Not enough to actually blow us up."

Chen considered. "Risky, but doable."

"Reyes, I want a firing solution on that thing. Don't shoot unless I give the word, but make it obvious we're targeting it."

"Aye, Captain."

Elena looked around the table. Scared faces, but determined. Good.

Dr. Sarah Chen from medical spoke up. "Captain, we should discuss medical readiness. If there's conflict, we'll have casualties. I need to know our combat posture."

"Our posture is defensive. We're not starting a fight." Elena brought up medical protocols on the display. "But you're right to prepare. What do you need?"

"Trauma bays are prepped. Neural dampeners are ready if we encounter energy fields like Phobos. But I'm worried about something else." Dr. Chen hesitated. "If this thing communicates through neural interfaces, anyone with implants could be vulnerable. That includes you, Captain."

The room went quiet. Everyone knew about Elena's cybernetic arm, her neural links. They also knew what had happened to Katie on Phobos.

"Noted," Elena said evenly. "If my implants become compromised, Marcus assumes command immediately. No hesitation, no debate. Understood?"

Marcus nodded grimly. "Understood."

"Anyone else with neural augmentation needs to report to medical before we initiate contact. I want neural limiters installed on everyone. If this thing tries to interface with us, we control the bandwidth." Elena looked at Dr. Chen. "Can you do that?"

"Yes. It'll reduce implant functionality by thirty percent, but it'll prevent cascade failures."

"Do it. Next item—" Elena pulled up the timeline. "We initiate our test in six hours. That gives us time to prepare, brief the crew, and get our systems locked down. Patel, I want you monitoring every wavelength. The moment that thing changes behavior, I need to know."

"What exactly are we looking for?" Patel asked.

"Curiosity. Aggression. Fear. Anything that tells us it's not just a mindless probe." Elena zoomed in on the anomaly. "It's been mirroring us for three days. That suggests intelligence. Possibly even caution. I want to see if we can establish a pattern of communication—even if it's just action and response."

"And if it responds with violence?" Reyes asked.

"Then we know it's hostile, and we respond accordingly. But I don't think it will." Elena thought of Katie's logs, the mathematical proofs, the sense of wonder in her sister's voice. "I think it's as curious about us as we are about it."

"Based on what evidence?" Marcus challenged.

"Based on the fact that it hasn't destroyed us yet. It had three days to do it. Instead, it's watching." Elena closed the tactical display. "That's not predatory behavior. That's investigative."

The senior staff exchanged glances. Elena could see the doubt, the fear. But also the trust. They'd followed her this far. They'd follow her a little further.

"All right, people. You have your assignments. Dismissed."

The room emptied quickly. Only Marcus remained.

"Risky play," he said.

"It's all we've got." Elena stared at the anomaly on the display. Patient. Watching. Waiting.

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we tried peace first. That has to count for something."

Marcus stood. "For what it's worth, I think you're right. About the anomaly being curious. But Captain—curiosity killed more than just cats."

"Then let's make sure we're smarter than cats."

After he left, Elena stayed in the briefing room, studying the tactical data. Six hours until they made contact. Six hours to prepare for something humanity had never attempted before.

She thought of Phobos. Of Katie's excitement in those final logs. Of three hundred people who'd died because someone had been too scared or too arrogant to try communication.

This time would be different.

This time, Elena would get it right.

Or die trying.
