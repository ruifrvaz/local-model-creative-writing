The drill bit stopped at forty meters. Hassan watched the torque readings spike, then drop to zero.

"That's not right." He checked the seismograph display. Solid rock for another hundred meters, according to the surveys. But the drill said otherwise.

Tanaka leaned over his shoulder. "Cavity?"

"Maybe. Or the density readings were wrong." Hassan adjusted the ground-penetrating radar. "Running a secondary scan."

The results painted an impossible picture. A void, roughly spherical, eight meters in diameter. Buried beneath the Martian regolith where nothing should exist except basalt and iron oxide.

"Natural formation?" Tanaka asked.

"No. Look at the edges." Hassan highlighted the boundary. Too smooth. Too regular. "This was excavated."

"By what? Mars doesn't have tectonics. No water erosion at this depth. And we're five hundred kilometers from the nearest geological feature."

Hassan stared at the data. She was right. Mars was geologically dead. Had been for billions of years. Whatever created this cavity, it wasn't natural processes.

"We need to see it," he said.

"Rivera won't approve an exploratory dig. Not when we're behind on habitat expansion."

"Then we don't tell her." Hassan pulled up the construction schedule. "The foundation for Module D cuts right past this location. We drill there anyway. If we happen to encounter something interesting..."

Tanaka smiled. "Accidentally discover a significant geological anomaly while performing routine construction work."

"Exactly."

They worked through the night, repositioning the drill rig. By morning, the official logs showed standard foundation work. The actual drill path angled directly toward the void.

At thirty-eight meters, the bit broke through.

Hassan felt it—a sudden loss of resistance, then the drill spinning free. He killed the motor and locked the shaft. "We're in. Prep the camera probe."

Tanaka lowered the fiber-optic camera down the drill hole. Hassan watched the feed on his tablet, expecting to see an empty cavity. A bubble in the ancient lava flow, nothing more.

Instead, he saw walls.

Smooth walls. Dark material that absorbed the camera's light. And on those walls, patterns. Geometric shapes that repeated with mathematical precision.

"Holy shit," Tanaka breathed.

Hassan's hands trembled as he maneuvered the camera. The patterns covered every surface—lines, circles, interconnected nodes forming networks that suggested structure. Purpose.

"This isn't natural," he said.

"No. It's not."

They stared at the screen. The implications cascaded through Hassan's mind, each more staggering than the last. An artificial structure. Underground. On Mars. Billions of years old, if the surrounding geology was any guide.

"We need to tell someone," Tanaka said.

"Who? Rivera? She'll shut this down, classify it, bury it under corporate protocols." Hassan saved the footage to an encrypted drive. "We need more data first. Samples. Detailed imagery. Proof that can't be ignored or suppressed."

"And if whatever made this is still down there?"

Hassan looked at the patterns again. They were beautiful in a cold, alien way. The work of a intelligence that thought in geometries humanity couldn't quite grasp.

"Then we're making the most important discovery in human history," he said. "And I'm not letting anyone take that away."

He grabbed the sample extraction kit. Tanaka caught his arm.

"Hassan. Think about this. If you're right, if this is what it looks like, this changes everything. Our mission. Our priorities. Our entire understanding of—"

"I know." He pulled free gently. "That's why we need to move fast. Before someone decides the colony is more important than the truth."

Tanaka studied his face. Then she nodded and reached for her own equipment. "Then we'd better work quickly. The morning shift starts in three hours."

They expanded the drill hole, working with surgical precision. Each centimeter took ten minutes. If they damaged the structure, if they contaminated the site, the scientific value would plummet.

At fifty centimeters, the hole was wide enough for the sampling arm. Hassan lowered it carefully, watching the camera feed. The arm's gripper extended toward the wall.

Contact. The material felt different under the sensors—not rock, not metal. Something between organic and crystalline. The spectral analysis showed compounds that shouldn't exist naturally. Carbon chains too complex. Mineral structures too ordered.

The sample came free with a whisper. Hassan sealed it in the containment vessel, hands shaking with a mix of fear and excitement.

"Got it." He raised the arm. "Now we run every test we have. Chemical analysis, radiocarbon dating, structural imaging."

"And then?"

"Then we make sure this gets back to Earth. No matter what Rivera says. No matter what the corporate oversight team wants." Hassan looked at the void on the screen, at the alien geometry that stared back with silent patience. "Because if they built this, they might have built more."

Tanaka was quiet for a moment. "You think they're still here. Somewhere."

"I think Mars wasn't always dead. And I think someone was here before it died." Hassan packed the sample carefully. "The question is whether they left. Or just went underground."

The camera continued recording. In the void, the patterns seemed to shimmer in the LED light. Maybe it was a trick of the resolution. Maybe it was dust in the lens.

Or maybe something down there was watching back.

Hassan saved the footage and encrypted the files. Whatever happened next, the universe had just gotten a lot more complicated.

And the colony's water recycling problems seemed suddenly very small.
