Lena Volkov found the second bomb at 0600.

She'd been running grid searches through the station's ventilation systems since the market attack. Looking for explosive residue. Tracking chemical signatures. Following the bomber's trail through miles of ductwork.

The device was hidden in a maintenance junction near the primary life support processors. Same design as the market bomb. Same materials. But ten times larger.

This wasn't a demonstration. This was extinction-level sabotage.

"Director, we have a problem." Lena activated her secure channel to Nkrumah. "I found another device. Big enough to take out the entire environmental system. If it detonates, the station dies."

Nkrumah's voice came back immediately. "Location?"

"Junction Twelve, Delta Ring. I'm looking at it now." Lena pulled up her scanner. "The timer shows sixty-three hours. Whoever planted this wanted to give the peace talks time to fail before finishing the job."

"Can you disarm it?"

"Not without specialized equipment. And not without knowing the trigger mechanism. This thing looks rigged with anti-tamper protocols. I touch it wrong, it could detonate early." Lena photographed the device from every angle. "We need to evacuate."

"Eight thousand people? In sixty-three hours? That's impossible. The emergency craft can't handle that volume."

"Then we find the bomber. Fast." Lena started backtracking the chemical trail. "I'm following the residue pattern. Whoever placed this bomb left traces. Skin cells, clothing fibers, atmospheric displacement. They were careful. But not perfect."

She moved through the ventilation system with practiced speed. Twenty years of station security had taught her every access tunnel, every maintenance corridor, every hidden space where people went when they wanted privacy or secrecy.

The trail led to a residential section. Diplomatic quarters. The restricted zone where only credentialed personnel had access.

Someone with clearance had planted the bomb. Someone the security systems wouldn't flag.

Lena pulled up access logs. Seventeen people had entered Junction Twelve in the past week. She cross-referenced with the market bombing timeline.

Three names appeared on both lists. Three people who'd been near both bomb sites during placement windows.

Ambassador Zhang. Coalition representative.
Engineer Takashi. Station maintenance.
Dr. Sarah Okonkwo. Medical officer assigned to the diplomatic delegation.

Lena felt her stomach drop. Any one of them could be the bomber. Or all three could be working together. Or none of them, and someone else had framed them perfectly.

She activated her comm to Captain Martinez, the Coalition security observer.

"Martinez, I need deep background on three people. Ambassador Zhang, Engineer Takashi, Dr. Okonkwo. Financial records, communication logs, travel history. Everything."

"That's going to step on jurisdictional toes."

"We have sixty-three hours before a bomb kills everyone on this station. I don't care about toes." Lena sent the data files. "Prioritize anyone with demolitions training or chemical engineering background. And look for recent large financial transfers. Someone's paying for this."

Martinez was quiet for a moment. "Volkov, if the bomber is one of our people, if it's Zhang—"

"Then he answers for it. Same as anyone else." Lena moved toward the diplomatic quarters. "Neutrality means everyone gets equal treatment. Including equal accountability."

She reached the residential section to find it in lockdown. Security teams at every entrance. Nkrumah had moved fast.

"Nobody in or out until we clear them," the Director said, meeting her at the checkpoint. "I've ordered all three suspects to report for questioning."

"They'll run."

"Let them try. I've got security on every airlock, every docking port, every maintenance access." Nkrumah's expression was stone. "If they're on this station, we'll find them."

Lena pulled up the station schematic. Eight thousand people spread across thirty kilometers of corridors and modules. Finding three suspects would take hours. Maybe days.

And they had sixty-three hours before the bomb detonated.

"We need to split up," she said. "You take Zhang. Martinez takes Takashi. I'll find Okonkwo."

"Alone? If she's the bomber—"

"Then I'll arrest her or die trying." Lena checked her sidearm. "Director, someone on this station wants the peace talks to fail badly enough to commit genocide. That kind of conviction makes people dangerous. And desperate. We can't afford to be gentle."

Nkrumah nodded slowly. "Find her. Bring her in. Alive if possible."

Lena headed for the medical section. Dr. Okonkwo's last logged position was her office, reviewing medical files from the market bombing victims.

The office was empty. Computer still active. Coffee still warm.

She'd left in a hurry.

Lena pulled up security footage. Okonkwo had departed seventeen minutes ago, immediately after the bomb discovery was logged in the system.

Someone had tipped her off. Someone with access to security channels.

Lena backtracked the doctor's path through the station. Medical section to residential corridors to—

The docking ring. Where the private shuttles were kept.

"All units, suspect Okonkwo heading for docking bay seven. Intercept and detain." Lena ran. The docking bay was two kilometers away. If Okonkwo reached a shuttle, if she undocked and burned away from the station, they'd never catch her.

She reached the bay to find the shuttle already powering up. Okonkwo visible through the cockpit window, running pre-flight checks.

Lena pulled her weapon. "Dr. Okonkwo, step away from the controls. You're under arrest for suspected terrorism."

Okonkwo looked up. Her expression was calm. Resigned. Like she'd expected this.

"I'm not the bomber, Chief Volkov. I'm trying to stop them."

"Then stop running and talk to me."

"Can't. They'll kill me if I stay. They already tried once." Okonkwo touched her neck. A bandage covered what looked like a recent wound. "The market bombing? I was the target. Not the civilians. They died because someone wanted me dead and didn't care about collateral damage."

Lena kept her weapon trained. "Who's 'they'?"

"I don't know names. But I know they don't want peace. They profit from the war. And they'll destroy this station to keep it going." Okonkwo continued the pre-flight sequence. "I planted a tracker on the second bomb. It's transmitting to this shuttle's computer. If I can get far enough from the station, I can triangulate the signal. Find out where the bomber is hiding."

"Or you planted the bomb and you're running before it detonates."

"Then why would I tell you about the tracker?" Okonkwo pulled up her computer. "Look. The signal's coming from somewhere in the station. Moving. The bomber is still here. Still active. And they're heading toward the tertiary environmental systems."

Lena glanced at the screen. The tracking signal was real. Moving through station corridors with purpose.

Toward another critical system.

"They're planting a third bomb," Lena said.

"And they'll keep planting until the station is rigged to explode from multiple angles. Redundancy. If we find one bomb, others detonate. If we evacuate, others trigger. They've planned for every contingency except one."

"Which is?"

"Someone tracking them in real-time." Okonkwo locked the shuttle. "I'm not running, Chief Volkov. I'm hunting. But I need to be mobile. Off the station. Tracking from a distance. You stay here, coordinate with Nkrumah. I'll feed you the bomber's location."

Lena hesitated. Everything about this felt wrong. But the tracking signal was genuine. And if Okonkwo was right, if there were multiple bombs scattered through the station, they needed every advantage.

"You run, I'll shoot you down myself," Lena said.

"Understood." Okonkwo sealed the shuttle. "And Chief? Tell Nkrumah to look at the financial records. Someone paid for this. Follow the money, you'll find the puppet masters."

The shuttle launched. Lena watched it burn away from the station, tracking signal still active.

She activated her comm. "Director, we have a situation. Okonkwo claims she's not the bomber. That she's being hunted. And she's tracking what might be a third bomb in progress."

"Do you believe her?"

Lena thought about it. The doctor's calm demeanor. The tracking signal. The bandage that suggested she'd been attacked recently.

"I believe someone on this station is trying very hard to make sure peace fails. Whether that's Okonkwo or someone else, we're running out of time to find out."

"Then follow her tracker. Find that bomber. I'll work the financial angle." Nkrumah paused. "And Lena? If she's lying, if this is a diversion, we need a backup plan."

"Already working on it. I'm pulling the bomb disposal team. If we can't catch the bomber, we'll just have to disarm every device they plant. One by one." Lena headed for the engineering section. "Sixty-two hours and counting. Let's make them count."

She ran through the corridors, weapon ready, mind racing.

Somewhere on this station, a bomber was planting death. And somewhere in the black, a doctor was either hunting them or leading security on a wild chase while the countdown ticked toward zero.

Lena didn't know which.

But she had sixty-two hours to find out.

And failure meant everyone died.

No pressure.
