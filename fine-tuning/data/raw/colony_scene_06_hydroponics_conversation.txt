The hydroponics dome smelled like earth and growing things. Yuki moved between the cultivation racks, checking nutrient levels and pH balance. Around her, lettuce and tomatoes grew under full-spectrum LEDs that mimicked Earth's sun.

"Nitrogen's low in section three," she noted, adjusting the feed mixture.

Behind her, the door cycled. Alexis entered, her expression the particular kind of tired that came from solving one crisis while three more waited.

"How are the plants?" Alexis asked.

"Better than us." Yuki gestured at the thriving crops. "They don't know Earth Corp's breathing down our necks. They just grow."

Alexis smiled faintly. "Must be nice."

They worked in companionable silence for a few minutes. Yuki had learned to read Alexis's moods over the past six months. When the structural engineer showed up in hydroponics, it meant she needed to think about something other than load-bearing calculations.

"The rationing announcement went over about as well as expected," Yuki said.

"Could've been worse."

"Could've been better." Yuki checked a tomato plant's root system. Healthy, spreading through the growth medium like veins. "People are scared. Not about the cold showers or reduced vegetables. About what it means."

"It means we're optimizing resources."

"It means Earth Corp doesn't trust us to succeed." Yuki looked up. "That's what the crew hears. That we're failing."

Alexis sat on one of the cultivation benches. Around them, plants grew in defiance of Martian hostility. Photosynthesis happened because humans had built a space for it. Life persisted because people like Yuki made it possible.

"We're not failing," Alexis said. "We're adapting."

"That's a nice way to describe desperation."

"It's an accurate way to describe survival." Alexis touched one of the tomato leaves. Smooth, alive, impossibly green against the red desert outside. "Earth didn't evolve to support human life either. We made it work through agriculture and engineering. Mars is just the next iteration."

Yuki mixed a new batch of nutrient solution. "You really believe that? That we can make Mars home?"

"I have to. Otherwise, what are we doing here?"

The question hung between them. Seventy-two people, millions of kilometers from Earth, working themselves to exhaustion for production metrics and survival margins. It had to mean something. Had to be building toward something more than corporate profit.

"I grew up in Osaka," Yuki said quietly. "Coastal city. By the time I was fifteen, the seawalls were failing. Storm surges every year. My family's apartment flooded three times before we relocated inland." She adjusted the LED arrays. "I came to Mars because Earth was drowning. Because someone said we needed a backup plan."

"And now?"

"Now I think maybe we needed a fresh start more than a backup." Yuki smiled. "No inherited mistakes here. No centuries of environmental damage. Just red rock and the chance to build something better."

Alexis thought about the cavity beneath Hab Three. About the presence that had offered them heat. About first contact with intelligence that predated human civilization.

"What if we're not the first?" she asked.

Yuki paused. "First what?"

"First to try making Mars home."

"You mean indigenous life? That's been theorized for decades."

"Not theorized. Confirmed." Alexis hadn't meant to say it. But Yuki was trustworthy, and secrets were heavy.

She told Yuki about the cavity. About the electromagnetic signals and the voluntary heat transfer. About Mars speaking in a language they were only beginning to understand.

Yuki listened without interrupting. When Alexis finished, she was quiet for a long moment.

"How long have you known?"

"Three days."

"And Rivera ordered you to keep it secret."

"For crew morale."

Yuki laughed—sharp and bitter. "Morale. We're rationing hot showers while something intelligent lives under our feet, and we're worried about morale."

"It's complicated."

"It's always complicated." Yuki returned to her plants. "You know what's not complicated? These tomatoes. Give them light, water, nutrients—they grow. No politics. No corporate metrics. No secrets."

Alexis watched her work. "You're angry."

"I'm tired of treating the crew like children who can't handle reality." Yuki's hands moved efficiently through the cultivation tasks. "We came to Mars knowing it could kill us. We signed up for danger. But we also signed up to be scientists and explorers. And you're asking me to lie by omission about the most important discovery in human history."

"I'm not asking. Rivera ordered."

"And you're following orders." Yuki met her gaze. "Elena Reeves had a cybernetic arm and survivor's guilt. What's your excuse?"

The comparison stung because it was accurate. Alexis had read the Phobos reports—studied Captain Reeves's decisions, her tendency to carry responsibility alone. The parallel was uncomfortable.

"I'm trying to keep this colony together."

"By keeping secrets? That's how things fracture." Yuki gestured at the hydroponics dome. "You want to know why these plants thrive? Because I don't lie to them about conditions. I adjust nutrients when they're stressed. I increase light when they're struggling. Transparency and adaptation."

Alexis felt the weight of the past three days settle heavier. "You think I should tell the crew."

"I think you should ask yourself: when Earth Corp eventually finds out—and they will—do you want them to hear it from us as a unified scientific discovery? Or do you want them to hear it as a security breach we tried to hide?"

It was a good point. Earth Corp would know eventually. Better to control the narrative than react to exposure.

"Rivera won't approve."

"Then convince her." Yuki handed Alexis a ripe tomato. "Or go around her. You're the chief structural engineer. You have authority to make safety disclosures. Call this a safety issue."

"Is it?"

"We're living on top of an alien intelligence that controls thermal energy. If that's not a safety issue, I don't know what is."

Alexis turned the tomato in her hands. Red, perfect, grown in Martian soil by human determination. Proof that life could persist in hostile places.

Maybe that included making room for neighbors.

"Thanks, Yuki."

"For what?"

"For not letting me become Elena Reeves."

Yuki smiled. "Elena Reeves died believing she had to face anomalies alone. You don't. We're a crew. Act like it."

Alexis left the hydroponics dome with the tomato and a decision. Rivera would object. Earth Corp would be furious. But Yuki was right—secrets fractured teams. Transparency built trust.

The colony needed trust more than comfortable lies.

She found Rivera in the command center, reviewing production reports.

"I'm disclosing the cavity to the crew," Alexis said without preamble.

Rivera looked up sharply. "I ordered you to—"

"To maintain operational security. Which I have. But operational security doesn't extend to scientific discoveries that affect crew safety and mission parameters." Alexis held up her tablet. "I'm filing this as a geological survey report. Public record. Available to all personnel."

"I could override that."

"You could. But you won't." Alexis met her gaze. "Because you know I'm right. This crew deserves to know what we found. And Earth Corp deserves to hear it from us first, framed as exploration success rather than hidden contact."

Rivera was quiet, calculating political angles. Finally, she nodded.

"Draft your report. I'll review it before distribution."

"Fair enough."

Alexis spent two hours writing. She framed the cavity as a xenobiological discovery—potential indigenous Martian life adapted to subsurface conditions. She emphasized the peaceful contact, the cooperative heat transfer, the possibility of coexistence.

She made it sound like hope instead of fear.

Rivera approved the report with minor edits. At 1800 hours, it went out to all crew members.

The response was immediate. Questions flooded the comm channels. Wonder. Excitement. Concern.

But not panic. Not fear.

The crew had come to Mars to explore. Alexis had given them something worth exploring.

She returned to the subsurface tunnel that night. The cavity pulsed steady and calm. Fifteen beats per minute. Content, if electromagnetic signatures could be content.

"We told them," Alexis said to the rock. "You're not secret anymore."

The cavity pulsed once. A greeting, maybe. Or acknowledgment.

Mars had neighbors. Humanity had neighbors.

Time to learn how to be good ones.
