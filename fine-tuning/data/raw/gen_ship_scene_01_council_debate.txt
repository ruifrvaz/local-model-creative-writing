Engineer Malik Torres stood in the observation dome, staring at the planet that wasn't supposed to be there.

Kepler-442b hung in the viewport like a promise. Marginally habitable. Eighty-three percent Earth gravity. Liquid water confirmed. Breathable atmosphere with oxygen supplementation.

Three hundred light-years closer than their original destination.

And directly in their path.

"Council's calling an emergency session," Captain Ana Reyes said, appearing at his shoulder. "They want your engineering assessment."

Malik pulled up the planetary data. "For what? Landing capability? We have that. This ship was designed for atmospheric entry."

"For settlement viability." Ana's voice was carefully neutral. "There's a faction pushing to abort the mission. Land here instead of continuing to Proxima Centauri."

Malik felt his stomach tighten. "That's not the plan. Our ancestors committed to Proxima. We're two hundred years into a four-hundred-year journey."

"Our ancestors are dead, Malik. We're the ones living with their choices." Ana pulled up the resource projections. "Look at these numbers. Genetic diversity is declining. Equipment failure rates are increasing. Another two hundred years might not be survivable."

"Or it might be." Malik highlighted the maintenance logs. "We've kept this ship running for two centuries. We can keep it running for two more."

"At what cost?" Ana gestured at the planet. "That's real. That's now. That's a chance to walk on actual ground instead of recycled deck plates."

"It's also a compromise. Proxima was chosen for specific reasons—stellar stability, orbital characteristics, long-term habitability. We don't know enough about Kepler-442b."

"We know it exists. We know it's habitable. That's more certain than a destination we won't reach for another two hundred years." Ana turned to face him. "Malik, be honest. Do you actually believe we'll make it to Proxima?"

Malik wanted to say yes. Wanted to believe in the mission, the plan, the purpose.

But he'd spent the last ten years maintaining systems that were degrading faster than designed. Patching hull breaches. Rationing spare parts. Watching genetic diversity numbers creep downward.

"I don't know," he admitted. "But giving up halfway seems wrong."

"It's not giving up. It's adapting." Ana pulled up the council agenda. "Come to the session. Make your case. But understand—this is bigger than engineering. This is about whether we honor our ancestors' choices or make our own."

The council chamber was packed. Third-generation crew, born and raised on the ship. Fourth-generation children who'd never seen a planet. Historians who'd dedicated their lives to preserving Earth culture. Engineers who kept the systems running.

Everyone had an opinion.

Dr. Eva Sato spoke first, her voice carrying the weight of the historical archives. "Our ancestors made a sacred commitment. Four hundred years to Proxima Centauri. We're the inheritors of that purpose. Abandoning it dishonors their sacrifice."

Medical Director James Okoye countered immediately. "Our ancestors also committed to species survival. Genetic analysis shows we're approaching critical diversity thresholds. Another two hundred years and we risk extinction through inbreeding."

"We have genetic banks," Eva argued. "Frozen embryos, carefully curated diversity—"

"Which require equipment that's failing at accelerating rates." James pulled up the medical projections. "Every generation, we're seeing increased genetic disorders. Reduced fertility. Immune system complications. The numbers don't lie."

Malik listened to the arguments. Science versus purpose. Survival versus honor. Present needs versus ancestral commitment.

Captain Ana called for his engineering assessment.

Malik pulled up the ship's status. Two centuries of accumulated damage, makeshift repairs, and declining redundancy.

"Can we make it to Proxima?" he said. "Mechanically, probably. The ship's structure is sound. Life support is functional. Propulsion is adequate."

He paused, knowing his next words would shape the debate.

"But every system is running on reduced capacity. We have no margins. One major failure—hull breach, reactor problem, life support cascade—and we're looking at catastrophic loss."

"So you're saying we can't make it?" someone called from the audience.

"I'm saying it's a risk. A calculable, manageable risk, but a risk nonetheless." Malik pulled up the probability models. "Two hundred years is a long time for nothing to go wrong."

"And Kepler-442b?" Ana asked. "Can we land safely?"

"The ship was designed for it. Entry protocols are intact. We have the equipment and expertise." Malik highlighted the planetary data. "But landing is permanent. Once we're on the surface, we can't leave. This ship becomes scrap metal."

"So it's a one-way choice," Eva said. "Land here and give up on Proxima, or continue and risk everything."

"Not quite," Dr. Okoye interjected. "There's a third option. Send a survey team. Land a shuttle, assess the planet properly. Make an informed decision rather than betting everything on incomplete data."

The council erupted in discussion. Practical. Cautious. Exactly the kind of compromise that appealed to people who'd spent their lives in controlled environments.

Ana called for order. "How long would a survey take?"

"Six months minimum," Malik said. "Three months to land, assess, and gather data. Three months to return and analyze."

"During which time, we continue toward Proxima," Eva said. "Preserving our options."

"And during which time, we use resources on a survey that might be pointless," someone countered. "If we're going to land, commit to it."

The debate raged for hours. Factions formed—traditionalists who wanted to continue to Proxima, pragmatists who wanted to land immediately, compromisers who wanted the survey option.

Malik found himself pulled in multiple directions. His engineering mind said survey—gather data, make informed decisions. His historical awareness said continue—honor the mission. His survival instinct said land—take the certainty over the risk.

When the council finally called for a preliminary vote, the results were split. Thirty-eight percent for continuing to Proxima. Thirty-five percent for landing immediately. Twenty-seven percent for the survey option.

No consensus. No clear direction.

"We'll reconvene in forty-eight hours," Ana announced. "Think about what we've heard. Talk to your departments. This decision affects everyone."

Malik returned to his quarters, his mind churning. The viewport showed Kepler-442b, growing slowly larger as the ship's trajectory carried them closer.

His personal terminal chimed. A message from his daughter, Amara. Sixteen years old, fourth-generation ship-born.

"Dad, I want to walk on a planet. I want to feel wind that isn't recycled air. I want to see a sky that isn't painted on a dome." Her young face was earnest. "I know the mission is important. I know our ancestors sacrificed. But they did that so we could live. And I want to actually live, not just exist in a metal tube."

Malik closed his eyes. She wasn't wrong. None of them were wrong.

That was the problem.

He pulled up the engineering logs, searching for certainty in numbers and systems analysis. The ship could make it to Proxima. Probably. The risks were manageable. Mostly.

But Amara would be sixty when they arrived. Sixty years of life on the ship, maintaining systems, following routines, preparing for a destination she might never see.

Was that living? Or just existing?

The planet rotated slowly in the viewport. Continents and oceans. Weather patterns. Actual geography instead of deck plans and corridor maps.

Malik pulled up the mission charter. The original document, signed by the first generation. Their commitment to reaching Proxima Centauri, establishing humanity's first interstellar colony.

It was beautiful. Idealistic. Born of hope and determination.

But it was also two centuries old. Written by people who'd lived on Earth, who'd known planets and weather and open spaces.

The current crew had never experienced any of that. They were ship-born. Space-raised. Their entire existence defined by bulkheads and life support systems.

Did they owe allegiance to ancestors they'd never met? Or did they owe it to themselves to choose their own path?

Malik didn't have an answer.

But he knew the debate would continue. Passionate. Divisive. Tearing at the fabric of the ship's social cohesion.

And in forty-eight hours, they'd have to decide.

Continue to Proxima and honor the mission.

Land on Kepler-442b and choose survival.

Or survey the planet and try to have it both ways.

Each option carried risk. Each option meant sacrifice.

And whatever they chose, some part of the crew would feel betrayed.

Malik looked at his daughter's message again. Her earnest face. Her simple desire to feel real wind.

Maybe that was the answer. Not engineering calculations or historical obligations.

Just the fundamental question: what kind of life did they want?

The debate would continue.

But Malik knew which way he was leaning.

Toward the planet. Toward the wind. Toward a future chosen rather than inherited.

The mission could wait.

Living couldn't.
