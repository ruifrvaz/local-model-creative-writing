The council chamber hummed with the vibration of the ship's main drive. Malik Torres felt it in his bones—a rhythm he'd known his entire life. Twenty-six years of constant acceleration, constant noise, constant motion toward a destination he'd never chosen.

"The data is clear." Dr. Eva Sato projected the genetic analysis onto the main screen. "We have eighteen generations until critical diversity loss. The original mission planners underestimated mutation accumulation."

Captain Ana Reyes leaned forward. "Eighteen generations is three hundred sixty years. We'll reach our destination in two hundred fourteen."

"If the destination is still viable." Medical Director James Okoye's voice was quiet but cut through the murmurs. "We've received no updated telemetry from the target system in forty years. For all we know, Tau Ceti f could be uninhabitable."

Malik watched the council members shift in their seats. Third-generation leadership, born into authority just as he'd been born into engineering. The weight of decisions made by people dead for a century pressing down on all of them.

"We have an alternative." Okoye activated a second display. "System HD 85512. Marginally habitable world, seventy-eight light-years behind us. We could decelerate, reverse course, arrive in ninety years instead of two hundred."

The chamber erupted. Voices overlapping, anger and fear and hope tangling into chaos. Captain Reyes let it continue for thirty seconds before activating the gavel.

"Order. I said order."

Silence fell. Malik studied the faces around the table. Desperation, calculation, uncertainty. No one on this ship had ever made a choice this large. The mission was sacred. The destination was destiny. You didn't just change course on a whim.

"HD 85512's world is barely habitable," Eva said. "Surface temperature extremes, thin atmosphere, limited water. We'd be condemning our descendants to hardship."

"As opposed to condemning them to extinction?" Okoye pulled up the genetic projections. "The numbers don't lie, Eva. We need genetic diversity or we need a shorter timeline. Those are our only options."

Malik cleared his throat. All eyes turned to him. He wasn't council, wasn't leadership. But the chief engineer had insisted he attend. Someone needed to represent the people who kept the ship running.

"What about the cryo banks?" he asked. "Don't we have genetic diversity stored?"

"We had diversity stored." Okoye highlighted a section of his report. "The radiation event in year eighty-two compromised sixty percent of the frozen embryos. What's left isn't enough to restore healthy diversity."

"Year eighty-two." Malik felt something cold in his stomach. "That was before my parents were born. Why are we only learning about this now?"

Silence. Captain Reyes met his eyes. "The second-generation council classified it. They were concerned about morale."

"They were concerned about control." Malik stood. "They knew we were running on borrowed time and they kept it secret. Now you're asking us to abandon two centuries of sacrifice because they couldn't face the truth?"

"Sit down, Engineer Torres." Reyes' voice carried authority three generations deep.

"No." Malik pulled up his own data on his tablet, transmitted it to the main screen. "You want to talk about options? Here's the ship's structural integrity over time. We have microfracture propagation in the main hull, radiation shielding degradation, and power system efficiency loss. Every year we travel, the ship gets weaker."

Eva was shaking her head. "The mission planners accounted for degradation."

"They accounted for two hundred years of degradation in ideal conditions. We've had seven major meteor impacts, two reactor incidents, and that radiation surge you mentioned. We're not operating in ideal conditions." Malik highlighted the critical systems. "If we commit to the full mission duration, we might not make it. The ship could fail before we reach Tau Ceti."

The chamber was silent now. Everyone staring at data they'd hoped they'd never have to confront.

"So we're trapped." Captain Reyes' voice was flat. "Continue forward and risk ship failure or genetic collapse. Turn back to a marginal world and abandon the mission. Those are our choices."

"There's a third option." Malik pulled up the engineering schematics. "We cannibalize the aft sections. Reduce our population footprint, concentrate in the forward modules, use the recovered materials to reinforce critical systems. Buy ourselves another century of safe operation."

"You're talking about controlled population reduction." Okoye's expression was unreadable. "That's—"

"Necessary. If we're committed to reaching Tau Ceti, we need to be realistic about what that requires."

Eva stood abruptly. "No. We're not discussing eugenics. We're not deciding who lives and who doesn't reproduce. That's a line we don't cross."

"Then we're deciding to die slowly instead." Malik heard the bitterness in his own voice. "We pretend everything is fine, maintain our current trajectory, and hope the ship holds together long enough for our great-grandchildren to discover we lied to them about their chances."

Captain Reyes raised both hands. "Enough. We're not making this decision today. We need full analysis, crew input, ethical review. This affects every person on the ship."

"It affects every person who'll ever be born on this ship," Malik corrected. "We're choosing their future without their consent."

"That's what our ancestors did to us," Reyes said quietly. "They chose this mission, this ship, this trajectory. We were born into their decision. Now it's our turn to choose for those who come after."

The weight of it settled over the chamber. Malik looked at the genetic projections, the structural analysis, the impossible math of survival in deep space. They'd been traveling for two hundred years. Every person on this ship was the product of that journey. Their culture, their language, their entire existence shaped by the mission.

And now they had to decide if the mission was worth dying for.

"We vote in one month," Captain Reyes said. "Full crew referendum. Continue to Tau Ceti, divert to HD 85512, or implement population controls to extend ship viability. Every adult gets a voice."

"And if the crew can't reach consensus?" Eva asked.

"Then we continue forward. The default is the original mission."

Malik wanted to argue, to demand better options, to reject the entire impossible situation. But the ship hummed around him, constant and familiar, carrying three thousand souls toward a future that might not exist.

Someone had to choose.

Might as well be them.
