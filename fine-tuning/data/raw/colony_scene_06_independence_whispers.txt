The hydroponics bay was Alexis's favorite place on Mars. Green growing things in a world of rust. Life thriving against impossible odds.

She found Yuki kneeling among the tomato plants, checking nutrient levels with quiet concentration.

"The audit results came back," Alexis said.

Yuki didn't look up. "How bad?"

"Better than expected. Corporate approved continued funding at current levels. No more cuts."

"That's... good. Why don't you sound happy?"

Alexis sat on a planter edge. "Because they're only funding us because we found the aquifer. Because we proved value. If we hadn't made that discovery, we'd be shut down by now."

"But we did make the discovery. We solved the problem. Isn't that worth celebrating?"

"It is. But Yuki, we got lucky. What happens next time when luck doesn't go our way?" Alexis gestured at the thriving plants. "All of this depends on Earth deciding we're worth the investment. We don't control our own fate."

Yuki finally looked up. "Is this about independence? Because I've heard Hassan talking about full Mars autonomy, cutting ties with Earth funding. That's decades away, if it ever happens."

"Maybe not decades. The aquifer changed things. We can sustain ourselves for water. Hassan's geothermal project will give us independent power. We're manufacturing our own spare parts now using the 3D fabrication systems. What else do we really need from Earth?"

"Genetics. Medical supplies. Advanced electronics. Food supplements. Replacement personnel." Yuki ticked off items on her fingers. "We're more self-sufficient, but we're not independent."

"Not yet. But we could be. With the right investments, the right focus."

Yuki studied her friend's face. "You're serious about this."

"I'm considering possibilities. That's different from committing to action."

"Alexis, even considering Mars independence is treasonous by Earth corporate law. If they knew you were thinking this way—"

"They'd cut our funding immediately and prosecute us for sedition. I know." Alexis pulled up colonial law documents on her tablet. "Which is why it's just theoretical discussion. Among friends. Off the record."

"You want me to keep this quiet."

"I want you to think about it. Really think. Do we want to spend the next thirty years begging Earth for permission to survive? Or do we take control of our own destiny?"

Yuki returned to her plants, but Alexis could see her mind working. The engineer in her calculating possibilities, weighing options.

"How would it even work?" Yuki asked finally. "Declaring independence without Earth support?"

"We'd need to be completely self-sufficient first. Water, power, food, medical capabilities, manufacturing. Then we'd need political coordination with other Mars colonies. Present a united front."

"You've been thinking about this a lot."

"Hassan and I have been talking. Dr. Martinez has thoughts. Rivera..." Alexis hesitated. "Rivera is conflicted. She took an oath to Earth corporate. But she sees what we see. We're building something here that's bigger than corporate profit margins."

"And you want me to be part of the conspiracy?"

"I want you to be part of the conversation. Big difference."

Yuki was quiet for a long moment. Then she smiled slightly. "When you put it that way. Okay. I'll think about it. But Alexis, if we do this—if we seriously pursue independence—it'll be the hardest thing we've ever done."

"Harder than surviving that dust storm on four days of reserves?"

"Infinitely harder. Because that was just engineering. This is politics, economics, military strategy. We're not qualified."

"Nobody was qualified to colonize Mars either. We figured it out." Alexis stood. "I'm not saying we do it tomorrow. Or even next year. I'm saying we start preparing. Build capabilities. Create options. So when the time comes, we're ready."

"And if the time never comes?"

"Then we've built a better, more resilient colony. That's valuable regardless of political status."

Commander Rivera found Alexis in the engineering bay that evening, working on maintenance schedules.

"We need to talk," Rivera said, closing the door.

"About independence?"

Rivera didn't look surprised. "Yuki told you I've been thinking about it."

"Hassan told me. He says half the colony is quietly discussing it."

"More than half. The people born on Mars are especially interested. They don't feel loyalty to Earth. This is their home." Rivera pulled up population statistics. "In five years, Mars-born will outnumber Earth-born colonists. In ten years, the ratio will be three to one. We're raising a generation that doesn't identify with Earth corporate authority."

"That's... significant."

"That's inevitable. The question is how we manage it. Do we prepare for peaceful transition, or do we stumble into conflict?"

Alexis felt the weight of the question. "You're the commander. You could shut down this talk. Enforce Earth corporate loyalty."

"I could. But should I? These people risked everything to come to Mars. To build something new. Is it fair to trap them in Earth's political structures forever?"

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I'm with you. Quietly. Carefully. But if Mars wants independence, I won't stand in the way. I'll help make it happen." Rivera met her eyes. "But Alexis, we need to be smart. Earth won't just let us go. They've invested billions in Mars infrastructure. They'll see independence as theft."

"So we buy them out. Pay for our infrastructure, compensate their investment."

"With what money? We're barely solvent as a colony."

"With mineral rights. We have the aquifer, the geothermal potential, the subsurface mineral deposits Hassan's been mapping. We negotiate a long-term resource deal—Mars provides materials at negotiated rates, Earth provides advanced technology and expertise. Trade relationship instead of colonial subjugation."

Rivera considered it. "That might work. If we can get other Mars colonies aligned. If Earth sees more value in trade than control. If a hundred other variables break our way."

"Big if's."

"Huge if's. But possible." Rivera pulled up colonial treaties. "We'd need legal framework, economic agreements, defensive capabilities in case negotiations fail. Years of preparation before we're ready to even propose independence."

"Then we start preparing. Quietly. Build consensus among the other colonies. Develop economic models. Establish trade relationships independent of Earth corporate control."

"And if Earth finds out what we're planning?"

"We make sure they don't. This stays between senior staff. People we trust absolutely. No electronic communication, no records. Just careful planning and patient execution."

Rivera nodded slowly. "I'll talk to the other colony commanders. Gauge interest, assess viability. You focus on making us economically independent. Hassan continues geological surveys. Yuki handles life support improvements. We build capability before we announce intent."

"How long do you think we have?"

"Before Earth decides we're too independent and cracks down? Maybe two years. Maybe five. Depends on Earth's political situation." Rivera stood. "We proceed carefully. One step at a time. No revolutionary rhetoric, no public declarations. Just quiet competence until we're ready."

After Rivera left, Alexis sat alone in the engineering bay, thinking about what they were contemplating. Rebellion. Independence. The end of Earth's Mars colonies and the beginning of Mars civilization.

It was insane. Dangerous. Probably doomed to fail.

But it was also necessary. Inevitable.

Mars wasn't a colony anymore. It was becoming a world.

And worlds didn't stay colonies forever.

Alexis pulled up the colony's resource projections. Three years to full water independence using the aquifer. Four years to energy independence using Hassan's geothermal systems. Five years to manufacturing capability for most essential components.

Five years until they could actually survive without Earth support.

Then the real work would begin. Political organization. Economic negotiations. Military preparedness in case Earth responded with force.

It would take a decade. Maybe more.

But Alexis had spent three years turning a collection of habitat modules into a thriving colony. She could spend a decade building a nation.

Hassan appeared in the doorway. "Heard you and Rivera had a chat."

"News travels fast."

"It's a small colony. Hard to keep secrets." Hassan pulled up his geological surveys. "I've been thinking about your independence talk. I want to show you something."

The survey showed subsurface mineral deposits extending far beyond their current mining operations. Rare earths, platinum group metals, thorium deposits that could support nuclear power for centuries.

"That's..." Alexis stared at the numbers. "That's trillions of credits worth of materials."

"Conservatively. And it's all within our claim boundaries. Earth corporate knows some of it exists, but they don't know the full extent. I've been careful about what I report."

"You've been hiding survey data from Earth?"

"I've been ensuring Mars's negotiating position is strong when the time comes. There's a difference." Hassan smiled. "We're sitting on enough wealth to fund our own civilization, Alexis. We don't need Earth's money. We need time to extract and leverage it."

"Does Rivera know?"

"She does now. I briefed her this morning. It's part of why she's willing to support independence. We actually have the resources to succeed."

Alexis felt something shifting. Not just possibility, but probability. They could actually do this.

"How many people know about the full extent of these deposits?"

"You, me, Rivera, and now Yuki since she'll need to know for industrial planning. That's it. We keep it that way until we're ready to negotiate."

"Agreed." Alexis pulled up colonial population projections. "Hassan, we're not just building a colony anymore. We're building a nation. That changes everything."

"I know. Exciting, isn't it?"

"Terrifying."

"That too." Hassan clapped her shoulder. "But we're engineers, Alexis. We solve impossible problems. Nation-building is just another engineering challenge."

"With higher stakes and no margin for error."

"Exactly like every other day on Mars."

Alexis laughed despite herself. "Fair point."

Outside the window, Mars turned slowly under the distant sun. Red soil stretched to the horizon, dotted with colony installations and survey markers.

Home. Not Earth's outpost. Home.

A world waiting to be born.

And Alexis Kwan, along with a small group of engineers, scientists, and dreamers, was going to midwife that birth.

It would take years. Cost everything.

Probably fail.

But maybe—just maybe—they'd succeed.

And Mars would be free.

Not today. Not tomorrow.

But someday.

That was enough to keep working toward.

Enough to risk everything for.

Enough to believe in, even when belief seemed foolish.

Mars had taught them all to believe in impossible things.

Independence was just one more impossibility.

One more problem to solve.

One more frontier to cross.

And Alexis had never met a frontier she didn't want to explore.
