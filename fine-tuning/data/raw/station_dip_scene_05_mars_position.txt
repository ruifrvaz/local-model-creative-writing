The Mars delegation entered conference room six with the casual confidence of people who'd already won something. Chen watched them file in—efficient, coordinated, nothing wasted on ceremony.

Commander Rafael Osei led the group. Compact build, eyes that tracked every detail, posture suggesting military training that hadn't faded with transition to diplomatic service. Two advisors flanked him: Dr. Marcus Webb, colonial economics specialist, and Lieutenant Sarah Chen, Mars Defense Force liaison.

Lena remained by the door, her presence less intrusive than before. Learning from the Coalition meeting.

"Commander Osei." Chen gestured to seats. "Welcome to Unity Station."

"Ambassador. Thank you for facilitating these discussions." Osei's accent carried the clipped efficiency of someone who'd spent time in environments where air was expensive. "We appreciate neutral ground."

"Neutrality requires active maintenance." Chen pulled up the same basic agenda he'd shown Coalition. "Let's start with Mars position. What do you hope to achieve?"

"Recognition of colonial sovereignty." Osei spoke without hesitation. "Earth Coalition treats outer settlements as subsidiaries. We're independent political entities with right to self-determination. That needs acknowledgment in policy, not just rhetoric."

"Coalition would argue that independence requires self-sufficiency. Most colonies depend on Earth for critical supplies."

"Dependencies that exist because Coalition maintains monopolies on advanced manufacturing." Dr. Webb leaned forward. "We're building industrial capacity, but Earth uses patent restrictions and trade barriers to prevent genuine economic independence. They want us dependent."

"Do they? Or do they want return on centuries of investment in space infrastructure?"

"Infrastructure we maintain and expand with our labor." Lieutenant Chen's voice was controlled but carried edge. "Earth doesn't get to claim permanent ownership of human space because they had head start."

Chen made notes. The Mars position mirrored Coalition's rigidity—uncompromising stance on core issues, moral certainty about their grievances, limited willingness to acknowledge opposing perspectives.

Perfect conditions for deadlock.

"What specific changes would satisfy Mars?" he asked.

Osei pulled up a document. "Formal recognition of colonial political autonomy. Reduced Coalition military presence in colonial space. Fair trade agreements without preferential Earth pricing. Technology transfer for critical manufacturing capabilities."

"That's effectively demanding Coalition surrender strategic advantages built over two centuries."

"Or it's demanding they acknowledge that humanity's expansion into space doesn't belong exclusively to one planet." Osei's expression was firm. "We're not asking for charity. We're claiming rights that Earth governments claimed for themselves when they broke from colonial powers centuries ago. History matters."

"History also shows that violent independence movements tend to produce outcomes worse than continued negotiation." Chen switched displays. "Coalition is concerned about colonial military buildups. They've shown me intelligence suggesting weapons platforms in the outer belt."

The Mars delegation exchanged glances. Whatever they knew, they'd coordinated their response beforehand.

"We're building defensive installations," Osei said. "Response to Coalition fleet movements that threaten colonial security."

"Define 'defensive.' Coalition classifies kinetic kill systems as offensive weapons."

"Coalition classifies anything that might inconvenience their ships as offensive." Lieutenant Chen pulled up tactical displays. "We're three hundred million kilometers from Earth with populations that survive on closed life support. If Coalition decides to enforce policy through military action, we can't evacuate. We can't retreat. Our only option is make aggression too costly to attempt."

"Deterrence theory."

"Survival strategy."

Chen let silence settle. The Mars position was defensible in abstract, terrifying in practice. Both sides building weapons, both claiming defensive necessity, both convinced the other was preparing first strike.

Classic security dilemma. And historically, those ended badly.

"Let's talk about what you know regarding potential sabotage," he said.

The temperature in the room shifted. Osei's expression became carefully neutral.

"What have you heard?" he asked.

"That multiple parties received intelligence about threats to these negotiations. Someone who wants talks to fail." Chen watched reactions. "Coalition shared their concerns. I'm asking if Mars has similar information."

Osei looked at his advisors. Some silent communication passed between them.

"We've had warnings," Osei said carefully. "Sources suggested extremist elements might attempt to disrupt negotiations. We took precautions."

"What kind of precautions?"

"Enhanced security screening for our delegation. Counter-surveillance monitoring. Threat assessment protocols." Osei met Chen's eyes. "Standard procedures for high-risk diplomatic events."

"Did your sources identify specific threats? Methods, timing, targets?"

"Nothing concrete. Just general warnings about potential sabotage." Osei's tone suggested he was choosing words carefully. "Why? Has something happened?"

"Not yet. But multiple intelligence streams pointing to same concern suggests either genuine threat or coordinated disinformation campaign." Chen pulled up timeline. "Both possibilities are dangerous."

Dr. Webb spoke up. "If someone's trying to derail negotiations, question is who benefits. War serves certain interests—weapons manufacturers, nationalist politicians, military contractors who profit from conflict."

"True on both Earth and colonies," Chen said. "Which means saboteur could represent either side. Or neither."

"Third party interference?" Lieutenant Chen looked skeptical. "Who else has stakes in Earth-Mars relations?"

"Anyone invested in destabilizing humanity's expansion into space. Competing economic interests. Ideological groups opposed to settlement. Criminal organizations that benefit from political chaos." Chen gestured to Lena. "Chief Volkov is investigating all possibilities."

Lena stepped forward. "Commander Osei, if you have intelligence about specific threats, I need that information. I can't protect people from dangers I don't know about."

Osei considered. "Our information came through unofficial channels. Sharing might compromise sources."

"Your sources are less important than preventing deaths aboard this station." Lena's voice was flat. "Share what you know, or accept responsibility if something happens that you could have prevented."

The two security professionals studied each other. Some calculus of trust and risk and professional duty.

"I'll need to consult with Mars government," Osei said finally. "Authorization to share intelligence with neutral third party."

"You have six hours before preliminary negotiations start tomorrow." Lena pulled up contact protocols. "After that, I assume you're withholding information deliberately."

Chen moved back to his agenda before tensions could escalate. "Let's return to substantive issues. Mars wants sovereignty recognition. What are you willing to offer in exchange?"

"Continued cooperation on scientific research. Trade relationships that benefit both sides. Peaceful coexistence instead of military confrontation." Dr. Webb pulled up economic projections. "War destroys value for everyone. Peace creates opportunities."

"Coalition wants guarantees against colonial aggression."

"We want guarantees against Earth military action. Mutual verification seems obvious solution."

"Which requires trust both sides clearly lack." Chen made more notes. "Tomorrow's session will focus on building verification mechanisms. I want proposals from both delegations—what you're willing to allow monitoring of, what you need to see from the other side."

"Same request you made to Coalition?" Osei asked.

"Identical. Building framework requires both sides contributing equally."

Osei nodded slowly. "We'll prepare proposals."

"One more thing." Chen pulled up casualty projections—same data he'd shown Coalition. "Fleet analysis of potential conflict. Fifty thousand dead in first week. These aren't abstract numbers. These are people with families, dreams, futures. Your people and Earth's people."

The Mars delegation studied the projections in silence. Lieutenant Chen's expression suggested she'd seen similar analysis.

"We don't want war," Osei said quietly. "But we won't accept permanent subjugation to prevent it."

"Then find third option. That's why we're here." Chen stood. "Tomorrow morning, 0900 hours. Both delegations in same room for first time. Make sure you're ready."

After Mars left, Lena pulled up surveillance footage of both meetings.

"They're hiding more than Coalition," she said. "Osei knows something specific about the sabotage threat. Something that scared him enough to run counter-surveillance before arriving."

"Which means the threat is real and credible." Chen reviewed his notes. "Both delegations received warnings. Both are taking security measures. Both are reluctant to share details."

"Because sharing might reveal their intelligence sources."

"Or because the saboteur is within one delegation and they're trying to identify them before negotiations start." Chen looked at the security feeds. "Lena, if you were planning to disrupt these talks, how would you do it?"

She considered. "Target infrastructure—life support, communications, power systems. Make it look like station failure rather than deliberate attack. Create chaos, force evacuation, negotiations collapse."

"And if you wanted to make one side look responsible?"

"Stage evidence. Plant materials from Coalition in Mars quarters or vice versa. Trigger incident during joint session when both delegations are present. Maximum confusion, maximum suspicion."

Chen felt pieces aligning in his mind. Not enough for complete picture, but enough to see the shape of what was coming.

"Increase monitoring on all infrastructure systems," he said. "Anything that could be sabotaged to create casualties or force evacuation. And Lena? Watch the advisors more than the delegation leads. Saboteurs are rarely the ones in charge."

"Already on it."

Chen returned to his office, mind processing information from both meetings. Two delegations, similar concerns, parallel structures of secrecy and fear.

Tomorrow they'd face each other directly.

He gave it even odds whether they'd find common ground or common enemy.

Both might be the same outcome.
