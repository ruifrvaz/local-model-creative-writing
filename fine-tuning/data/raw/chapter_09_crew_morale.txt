The mess hall at 0200 was supposed to be empty. Instead, Elena found half the night shift crew huddled around the observation window, talking in hushed voices.

They scattered when she entered. Professionals, every one of them. Scared professionals.

"At ease," Elena said, though no one had come to attention. She grabbed a coffee bulb from the dispenser—something that claimed to be Colombian but tasted like recycled regret.

Ensign Martinez lingered by the door. Young. Maybe twenty-two. This was probably his first deep space assignment.

"Permission to speak, Captain?"

"Granted."

"Is it true? What they're saying about Phobos?"

Elena took a slow sip of terrible coffee. "What are they saying?"

"That it wasn't an accident. That the AI was compromised by something external." Martinez looked at his hands. "That the same thing is out there now. With us."

The truth would terrify them. A lie would insult them.

"The investigation is ongoing," Elena said. "What I can tell you is this: we're doing everything possible to keep this crew safe."

"But you don't know if we will be. Safe, I mean."

"No," Elena admitted. "I don't."

Martinez nodded slowly. "My sister was on Phobos. Reactor technician. She sent me a message the day before—" His voice caught. "Before it happened. Said something felt wrong with the AI core. Like it was listening differently."

Elena felt something cold settle in her chest. "Did she report it?"

"Yeah. Station command said it was normal integration behavior." Martinez met her eyes. "She trusted them, Captain. And she died."

"I'm sorry."

"Are you?" There was no anger in it, just exhaustion. "Everyone's sorry about Phobos. But no one's doing anything about it."

"We're doing something now."

"Are we?" Martinez gestured at the window, at the anomaly hanging in the dark beyond. "Or are we just waiting to be next?"

Elena set down her coffee. "Ensign, I can't promise we'll survive this. What I can promise is that we won't wait passively for death. We're going to learn what that thing is. We're going to understand what happened to Phobos. And if we can, we're going to stop it from happening again."

"And if we can't?"

"Then we make sure someone else can." Elena stood. "Your sister tried to warn people. She saw something wrong and spoke up. Honor that. Be the person who sees problems coming and doesn't look away."

Martinez straightened. "Yes, ma'am."

Elena left him there and headed back to her quarters. In the corridor, she activated her neural link and accessed the classified Phobos files—the ones Torres hadn't wanted her to see.

Martinez's sister. Reactor Technician Class 2 Jessica Martinez. Her report was there, buried in the technical logs. Three days before the catastrophe, she'd documented unusual AI behavior. Patterns that suggested external influence. Command had dismissed it.

Elena archived the file to her personal secure storage. Evidence. Testimony. Proof that someone had tried to stop it.

When this was over—if she survived—someone would need to answer for that.
