Hassan stood in the ancient library chamber, surrounded by Earth's scientific team. Six specialists flown from various universities, each carrying more credentials than practical experience.

Dr. Sarah Chen—no relation to their Chen—led the group. Xenoarchaeologist. Published extensively on theoretical first contact scenarios.

Now facing actual alien artifacts and looking overwhelmed.

"The device responds to touch?" she asked for the third time.

"Physical contact initiates a data transfer. Visual, conceptual. I experienced the history of Mars's decline and the builders' final days." Hassan indicated the cylindrical object. "But it's selective. Not everyone who touches it receives the vision."

"How do you know?"

"Because Kwan tried. Rivera tried. They felt warmth but no information transfer." Hassan pulled up his notes. "I've theorized it requires specific neural patterns or perhaps genetic markers. The builders might have designed it to interface with certain types of consciousness."

Dr. Chen circled the device carefully. "We should establish protocols before further contact attempts."

"I've already made contact. Multiple times over the past four months."

"Unauthorized contact that could have contaminated the artifact or damaged your neural pathways."

Hassan felt irritation rise. "I took reasonable precautions. And learned more in four months than your team will learn in four years with your protocols."

"Dr. Hassan, I understand you've been working in isolation, but proper scientific methodology requires—"

"Survival required action. Methodology is a luxury we couldn't afford."

Rivera stepped between them. "Dr. Chen, I appreciate your expertise. But Hassan has established a functional relationship with the artifact. I suggest you build on his work rather than dismiss it."

Chen looked like she wanted to argue. Instead, she took a breath and nodded. "You're right. I apologize, Dr. Hassan. Your documentation is thorough. Would you be willing to guide us through the contact process?"

Hassan relaxed slightly. "Yes. But understand—the device chooses what to share. I can't control or predict the visions."

"Understood."

They spent the next three hours documenting everything. Chen's team deployed instruments Hassan had never seen—quantum resonance scanners, consciousness mapping equipment, neural interface monitors.

Expensive. Sophisticated. Probably unnecessary.

But they were thorough. Hassan respected that.

Finally, Chen suited up with neural monitoring gear and approached the device.

"Remember," Hassan said. "The vision is intense. Don't fight it. Let the information flow."

Chen nodded and placed her hand on the surface.

Nothing happened.

She held position for thirty seconds. A minute. Two minutes.

Still nothing.

"It's not responding," she said, frustration clear in her voice.

"Try asking a question. Sometimes intentionality matters."

Chen closed her eyes. "I want to understand who you were. What you built. Why you created this library."

The device hummed softly. Chen gasped, her eyes going wide behind the neural monitor's sensors.

Hassan watched the readouts. Her brain activity spiked—visual cortex, memory centers, emotional processing all lighting up simultaneously. Whatever she was experiencing, it was similar to his own contact.

After five minutes, the device went silent. Chen stumbled back, her face pale.

"I saw them," she whispered. "Not clearly. Impressions. But they were real. They lived here. Millions of years ago."

"And they died here," Hassan said quietly.

"No." Chen looked at him. "They didn't all die. Some left. Went somewhere else. The device showed evacuation. Ships leaving Mars as the atmosphere failed."

Hassan felt his breath catch. "I didn't see that part. The vision I received ended with the archival process."

"Maybe it shows different things to different people. Or maybe—" Chen pulled up her neural scans. "Maybe it's cumulative. Building a complete picture through multiple contacts with different consciousness patterns."

"A collaborative library," Hassan said. "Designed to share information with whatever intelligence eventually found it."

"Exactly."

They worked late into the Martian night, Chen's team cataloging and analyzing while Hassan provided context from his months of study. The friction from earlier dissolved into collaborative excitement.

Science transcending ego. Hassan had missed this—the pure joy of discovery shared with peers.

Around midnight, one of Chen's team members called out. "Dr. Chen, we've found something. The chamber's phosphorescence—it's not just light. It's data encoded in wavelength variations."

Everyone crowded around the analysis station. The patterns weren't random bioluminescence. They were structured information, repeating in sequences that suggested language.

"Can we decode it?" Chen asked.

"Given time, possibly. The patterns correlate with mathematical concepts. Primes, geometric ratios, physical constants. It's like the device's external interface—a universal language anyone with mathematics could potentially understand."

Hassan felt pieces clicking together. "The builders created multiple access methods. Visual visions for consciousness capable of abstract thought. Mathematical encoding for any intelligence capable of pattern recognition. They wanted to ensure their legacy survived, regardless of what form intelligence took when it eventually returned to Mars."

"They planned for this," Chen said with wonder. "Built a library that could communicate with anything from artificial intelligence to biological life forms vastly different from themselves."

"The ultimate message in a bottle," someone said.

"More than that." Hassan looked at the chamber, seeing it with new understanding. "It's an invitation. They're saying 'We were here. We learned. We built. And now it's your turn.'"

Chen smiled. "Then we'd better not disappoint them."

They worked through the night and into the next day. The scientific team's initial condescension had transformed into genuine partnership. Hassan found himself enjoying the collaboration—different perspectives, new theories, fresh approaches to problems he'd been wrestling with alone.

By the second week, they'd decoded basic portions of the phosphorescent language. Mathematical concepts. Astronomical data. Star charts showing Mars's position millions of years ago.

"They left us a map," one researcher said. "Showing where they went."

Hassan studied the coordinates. "That system is two hundred light-years away. Even with advanced propulsion, the journey would take—"

"Generations," Chen finished. "They were refugees. Running from a dying world and hoping to find a new home."

"Did they make it?"

"No way to know. But they left us the coordinates. Maybe someday we'll find out."

Hassan thought about humanity's colony on Mars. People fleeing Earth's crowded cities for a new frontier. History repeating across species and eons.

"We should send a probe," he said. "Eventually. When humanity has the capability."

"To search for ancient Martian refugees?"

"To honor their memory. And maybe learn from their fate."

Chen nodded slowly. "I'll add it to the mission recommendations."

They returned to work, decoding an ancient language one phosphorescent pulse at a time.

The builders were long gone. But their story remained.

And now, finally, someone was reading it.
