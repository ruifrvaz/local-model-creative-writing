The ore sample glowed faintly in the dark.

Not radioactive. Not chemically reactive. Just... luminescent.

Dr. Sofia Ruiz had extracted hundreds of asteroid samples. None had ever glowed.

"Captain Torres, you need to see this."

Jax Torres floated into the lab, his movements practiced in zero-g. "What am I looking at?"

"Sample from the latest asteroid. Designation KB-891." Sofia held up the container. "It's emitting light. No external power source. No chemical reaction. Just spontaneous photon emission."

Jax studied the sample. "Bioluminescence?"

"On an asteroid? Unlikely. But I'm running biological assays anyway." Sofia pulled up the spectroscopy data. "The light emission follows patterns. Not random. Regular pulses at specific frequencies."

"Patterns like what?"

"Like communication." Sofia highlighted the pulse sequence. "Prime numbers. Mathematical constants. The kind of patterns SETI programs look for."

Jax activated his comm. "Wrench, Kayla, lab meeting. Now."

The crew assembled in the cramped space that served as their laboratory.

"Sofia found a talking rock," Jax said. "Explain."

Sofia displayed the emission patterns. "The ore sample emits light in regular sequences. Mathematical patterns that suggest intelligence. Or at minimum, deliberate design."

Kayla pulled up her sensor logs. "I scanned that asteroid before we started mining. No electromagnetic emissions. No anomalies."

"The material only became active after extraction," Sofia explained. "Like exposure to vacuum or specific conditions triggered activation."

"Or we triggered something we shouldn't have," Wrench suggested. "Could be a beacon. Calling whoever left it."

"Or calling whoever it was warning against," Jax said. "Either way, we have glowing alien technology on our ship. Options?"

"We return it to the asteroid," Kayla suggested. "Put it back, hope it deactivates."

"We study it," Sofia countered. "This could be the most important discovery we ever make."

"It could also paint a target on us," Jax said. "If this is a beacon, someone might come looking."

They debated for an hour. Scientific value versus practical danger. Knowledge versus survival.

Finally, Jax made the call. "We study it for seventy-two hours. Document everything. If nothing catastrophic happens and we learn something useful, we continue. If something goes wrong, we jettison it immediately."

Sofia began comprehensive analysis. Chemical composition. Emission spectra. Crystalline structure. Every measurable property.

The ore was unlike anything in the standard catalogs. Elements that shouldn't exist in stable form. Molecular structures that violated normal chemistry. Quantum states that persisted at room temperature.

"This is engineered," Sofia concluded. "Not natural formation. Deliberately created with properties that shouldn't be possible."

"Who engineered it?" Wrench asked.

"Unknown. But they had technology beyond our current understanding." Sofia pulled up the atomic analysis. "These stable elements require conditions we can only create in particle accelerators. Someone made this in bulk and left it on an asteroid."

The emission patterns continued. Regular. Persistent. Mathematical.

On the third day, they changed.

The pulse sequence accelerated. New patterns emerged. More complex. More urgent.

"It's responding," Sofia said. "To our presence. To our study. It knows we're here."

Jax pulled up tactical sensors. "Do we have company?"

"Negative. No ships in sensor range. No unusual activity." Kayla ran full spectrum scans. "Just us and the glowing rock."

The patterns continued evolving. Building toward something. Sofia worked frantically to decode them.

"It's a map," she realized. "Or coordinates. Look—these pulses correspond to stellar positions."

She pulled up the star charts. The emission patterns pointed to a specific region of space. Forty light-years from their current position.

"It's directing us somewhere," Sofia said.

"Or warning us away from somewhere," Jax countered. "We don't know the context."

"Only one way to find out." Sofia met his eyes. "We go there. See what's waiting."

"That's forty light-years. Decades of travel with current drives."

"Or we sell this information. Let someone with FTL capability investigate." Sofia pulled up the commercial prospects. "Discovery like this could fund our operations for years."

Jax considered. "Assuming whoever we sell it to doesn't just take it and cut us out."

"Then we encrypt the coordinates. Sell access, not information. Make ourselves necessary to the expedition."

Kayla shook her head. "Or we keep it secret. Don't tell anyone. Don't attract attention we can't handle."

"Secret discoveries don't pay bills," Wrench pointed out. "And we need parts, fuel, supplies."

They argued through the night. Every option carried risk. Every choice had consequences.

Finally, Jax decided. "We publish the discovery. Make it public. Coordinates included. Let humanity deal with it collectively."

"That's leaving money on the table," Sofia protested.

"That's avoiding the target we'd paint on ourselves by hoarding alien technology." Jax pulled up the communications array. "We're miners. Not explorers. Not military. We find things, we report them, we move on."

The transmission went out the next day. Full documentation. Complete data. The glowing ore sample's emission patterns and the stellar coordinates they pointed toward.

Earth's response was immediate.

Scientific interest. Government inquiries. Private expedition proposals. Everyone wanting to investigate the indicated region.

And buried in the responses, one message caught Jax's attention.

From Earth's orbital stations. FTL development project. They had experimental drives. They could reach the coordinates within months instead of decades.

"Looks like someone's going to check it out," he told Sofia.

"Should we join them?"

"We're miners, not first contact specialists." Jax pulled up their prospecting schedule. "Let the professionals handle alien mysteries. We stick to what we're good at."

"Finding impossible things on random asteroids?"

"Exactly. It's a niche, but we're excellent at it." Jax secured the ore sample. "This goes to Earth for study. We get documented as discoverers. That's good enough."

They departed the asteroid, leaving it marked in the navigation charts as "Site of Interest—Alien Artifact Origin."

Another discovery. Another mystery. Another payday.

Life as independent miners.

Finding the universe's secrets one rock at a time.

And leaving the difficult questions to people better equipped to answer them.

Jax was fine with that.

Some mysteries were worth leaving unsolved.

At least by him.
