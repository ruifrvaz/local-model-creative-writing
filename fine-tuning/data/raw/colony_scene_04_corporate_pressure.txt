Commander Rivera's private quarters were smaller than most crew cabins. Her choice. She'd given the larger space to the medical bay.

She sat at her desk, staring at the message from Olympus Resource Corporation. It had arrived on the daily data packet, encrypted with her personal command codes.

The text was brief. Corporate brief.

*Mining quota unfulfilled. Contract penalties apply. Recommend personnel reduction to optimize resource allocation.*

Personnel reduction. Sanitized corporate speak for sending people home. Or more accurately, refusing to send the next supply ship unless she cut crew.

Rivera pulled up the colony's production numbers. They'd extracted twelve thousand tons of regolith in eight months. Processed it for rare earth elements, water, and construction materials. The numbers were solid. Respectable.

But the corporate contract demanded fifteen thousand tons.

She ran the math again. To hit quota, they'd need to increase operations by twenty-five percent. That meant longer shifts, more equipment stress, higher risk of accidents.

Or she could cut eight people and redistribute their workload.

Rivera looked at the crew roster. Forty-three names. Forty-three lives that depended on her decisions.

Who did she send back? The junior engineers who were still learning? The specialists who were expensive but critical? The support staff who kept morale high but didn't directly contribute to mining operations?

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in."

Dr. Sarah Kim entered. The colony's medical officer was efficient, precise, and had zero patience for corporate politics.

"You look like you're contemplating murder," Kim said.

"Close. Contemplating which crew members to sacrifice to corporate greed."

Kim sat down without being invited. "The personnel reduction demand."

"You saw it?"

"I see everything medical on this colony. Including stress markers." Kim pulled out her tablet. "You, Kwan, Hassan, and Tanaka are all showing elevated cortisol. The crew knows something's wrong."

"The crew doesn't need to know that Olympus wants to cut them."

"They'll find out. They always do." Kim leaned forward. "So what's your play?"

Rivera wanted to tell her. Wanted to share the burden of command with someone who'd understand. But that wasn't her job. Her job was to carry it alone.

"I'm working on alternatives."

"Alternatives to what? Choosing who stays and who goes?" Kim's expression was hard. "Commander, this colony is understaffed as is. We're running on minimal margins. Cut anyone and those margins disappear."

"I'm aware."

"Are you? Because from where I sit, you've got engineers working sixty-hour weeks, life support specialists pulling double shifts, and a geologist who's discovered something that might collapse our entire habitat." Kim stood. "We need more people, not fewer."

"Tell that to Olympus."

"I'd love to. Put me on the next comm."

Rivera almost smiled. Kim's brand of directness was refreshing in a world of corporate double-speak.

"If I refuse the reduction," Rivera said carefully, "Olympus can void our contract. Take over the colony directly. Install their own management."

"And you think their management would be better?"

"I think their management would cut costs ruthlessly and probably get people killed." Rivera pulled up the contract terms. "But I also think we're stuck between bad options and worse ones."

Kim was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "There's a third option."

"I'm listening."

"Hit the quota. Not by cutting people, but by working smarter." Kim pulled up production data on her tablet. "Look at this. We're spending forty percent of our processing time on rare earth extraction. But rare earths only account for fifteen percent of contract value."

"They're the highest profit margin."

"For Olympus. Not for quota fulfillment." Kim highlighted the regolith processing numbers. "If we focus on volume—basic construction materials, water ice, bulk metals—we can hit quota with current staffing."

Rivera studied the numbers. Kim was right. The math worked. But—

"Olympus won't like it. They want the rare earths."

"Olympus wants quota compliance. Give them that, and they can't void the contract." Kim met her eyes. "Then, when we're in compliance, we negotiate better terms."

It was risky. Olympus could claim breach of spirit even if they met the letter of the agreement. But it was better than cutting crew.

Rivera made her decision.

"Draft the new production plan. I'll present it to the senior staff tomorrow."

Kim nodded and stood to leave. At the door, she paused.

"Commander? You know you don't have to carry this alone, right?"

"It's my job to carry it."

"Your job is to keep us alive. Ours is to help you do that." Kim's expression softened slightly. "Delegation isn't weakness."

She left before Rivera could respond.

Rivera sat in silence, staring at the crew roster. Forty-three names. Forty-three people who'd volunteered for Mars knowing the risks. Knowing the corporate pressures. Knowing that survival meant more than just breathing.

She pulled up the message draft to Olympus.

*Revised production plan attached. Will achieve quota compliance within six weeks. Request confirmation of contract extension.*

Short. Professional. Carefully worded to sound confident without being confrontational.

She sent it and leaned back in her chair.

Outside her window, Mars stretched infinite and indifferent. The planet didn't care about quotas or contracts or corporate politics.

It only cared about physics. Chemistry. The mathematics of survival.

And right now, Rivera was betting that she could out-math Olympus Resource Corporation.

The tablet chimed. Not a response—too soon for that. Just the nightly status report.

Life support: stable. Power: adequate. Water: rationed but sufficient. Morale: holding.

Rivera added her own note to the log.

*Crew status: Stressed but functional. Leadership status: Determined. Mission status: Complicated.*

She closed the log and pulled out the personnel files. Not to choose who to cut. But to understand who she was fighting for.

Each file told a story. Engineers who'd left Earth to build something permanent. Scientists chasing questions that couldn't be answered in laboratories. Support staff who saw Mars as humanity's next step.

They'd trusted her to lead them. To make the hard calls.

So she would.

Rivera started drafting the new work schedules. Longer hours for her. Delegated decisions for the senior staff. Clear communication about goals and risks.

Kim was right. She didn't have to carry it alone.

But she did have to carry the final responsibility.

That was what command meant. Not making easy choices. But making the necessary ones.

And right now, the necessary choice was simple: Keep the crew together. Hit the quota. Prove to Olympus that Mars settlers were more than expendable labor.

They were humanity's future.

And Rivera would fight any corporation that forgot that.
