Commander Rivera stood before the assembled crew, her face carefully neutral. Two hundred people packed the common area, sitting on benches and standing along the walls. The air smelled like too many bodies in too small a space.

"Thank you for coming," she began. "I have an update from corporate."

Alexis Kwan stood near the back, arms crossed. She already knew what was coming. The transmission had arrived three hours ago, and Rivera had called an emergency staff meeting immediately after.

"Corporate has approved our request for equipment replacements," Rivera said.

A murmur of relief rippled through the crowd.

"However," Rivera continued, her voice hardening, "the replacements will arrive with the colony's first commercial mining operations team. Six months from now."

The murmur died.

"In the meantime, corporate has assigned us additional personnel." Rivera pulled up a holographic display. Names and faces appeared. "Fifteen mining engineers and support staff arrive next week. They'll be establishing preliminary excavation operations while we continue habitat construction."

Alexis felt her jaw tighten. More people. More strain on failing systems. More mouths to feed from dwindling supplies.

"Questions?" Rivera asked.

Alexis raised her hand. "Commander, we can't support additional personnel. Our life support is already operating at ninety-three percent capacity. The water recyclers are failing. Food production is barely keeping pace with current population."

"Corporate is aware of our concerns."

"And they're sending us fifteen more people anyway."

Rivera met her eyes. "Yes."

The room erupted. Voices overlapping, shouting questions and objections. Rivera let it run for thirty seconds before raising her hand.

"I understand your concerns. I share them. But corporate has made their decision, and we will implement it."

"Even if it kills us?" someone called from the crowd.

"We're not going to die." Rivera's voice cut through the noise. "We're going to adapt. That's what we do. Kwan's team will implement efficiency improvements. Tanaka will optimize hydroponics production. Hassan will identify new water sources. We will make this work."

Alexis wanted to believe that. Wanted to trust that engineering and determination could overcome the mathematics of resource depletion.

But the numbers didn't lie.

The meeting dispersed slowly, people clustering in small groups to voice complaints Rivera couldn't officially hear. Alexis waited until most had left before approaching.

"Commander, I need to speak with you. Privately."

Rivera nodded and led her to the office. Once the door sealed, Alexis didn't waste time.

"We can't do this. The systems won't support fifteen more people. You know that."

"I know corporate believes we can."

"Corporate is on Earth, breathing real air and drinking unlimited water. They don't understand what we're dealing with."

Rivera sat heavily in her chair. For a moment, she looked older than her forty-two years. Tired. Worn down by decisions that had no good answers.

"What do you want me to do, Alexis? Refuse the personnel? Violate my contract and get this entire colony shut down?"

"I want you to tell them the truth. That they're killing us."

"I did. In my last three reports." Rivera pulled up the correspondence. "They don't care. The mining operations are the entire point of this colony. Everything else is just infrastructure to support resource extraction."

Alexis read the messages. Rivera had been blunt, professional, and thorough. Corporate's responses were polite variations of "make it work."

"So we're expendable," Alexis said.

"We're assets. There's a difference, but it's smaller than I'd like."

Alexis leaned against the desk. "I can't guarantee the recyclers will hold another six months. Every repair brings us closer to catastrophic failure."

"Then we'll cross that bridge when we reach it."

"People will die, Commander. Maybe a lot of people."

"I know." Rivera met her eyes. "But right now, people are alive. My job is to keep them that way as long as possible. And that means following corporate's directives, even when those directives are shortsighted and dangerous."

"That's not good enough."

"It's what we have."

Alexis wanted to argue, to demand Rivera push back harder, to insist there had to be another way. But she'd read the contracts. Knew the legal framework that bound them all.

They'd signed up to build Mars's first colony. Corporate owned the colony. Corporate made the decisions.

The crew just lived with the consequences.

"What do you need from me?" Alexis asked finally.

"A miracle." Rivera smiled without humor. "Failing that, I need you to prepare for fifteen new arrivals. Expand the habitat capacity, optimize life support, make the impossible work. Same as always."

"And when it stops working?"

"Improvise. Adapt. Survive." Rivera stood. "That's what we're good at, Kwan. It's why corporate sent us here. We make the impossible routine."

Alexis left the office feeling hollowed out. The corridor stretched ahead, metal and shadows. Through the viewport, Mars gleamed red and indifferent.

She found Yuki in the hydroponics bay, working late as usual.

"Meeting went well, I see," Yuki said, reading her expression.

"Corporate's sending fifteen more people. Six months until equipment replacements arrive."

Yuki's hands stilled on the nutrient dispenser. "That's insane."

"That's business." Alexis sat on a grow bed bench. "How's the crop?"

"Stabilizing. The triple supplementation is working, but we'll run out of nutrients before resupply."

"Add it to the list of things that'll kill us."

They sat in silence, surrounded by growing things that represented the thin margin between survival and starvation. The plants didn't care about corporate politics or resource allocation. They just grew or died based on what they received.

Honest. Simple. Unlike everything else on Mars.

"We could refuse the new personnel," Yuki said quietly. "Tell them there's no room."

"Rivera already considered that. Corporate would replace her with someone more compliant."

"Then we're trapped."

"We're committed." Alexis stood. "There's a difference. We came here to build something permanent. That means surviving the people who fund us."

"Even if they're trying to kill us?"

"Especially then." Alexis headed for the door. "I'll draft expansion plans for the habitat. You focus on increasing food production. Hassan can map new drilling sites. We'll solve this the way we solve everything—one crisis at a time."

Yuki nodded slowly. "And when we run out of crises to solve?"

"Then we're probably dead and it won't matter anyway."

It wasn't comforting. But it was honest.

And on Mars, honesty was the only luxury they could afford.
