Commander Rivera stared at the transmission from Earth and felt the weight of three hundred million kilometers pressing down on her shoulders.

Budget review. Performance metrics. Return on investment projections.

Not one word about the subsurface anomaly. Not one acknowledgment that they'd found something unprecedented. Just questions about why drilling had stopped and when it would resume.

She closed the message and pulled up the geological data Omar had compiled. The cavity was definitely artificial. The seismic imaging showed geometric precision that nature didn't produce. And the magnetic pulse had strengthened—now detectable from the surface with sensitive enough instruments.

"Commander?" Alexis appeared in the doorway. "You wanted to see me?"

"Come in. Close the door."

Alexis's expression shifted—concern, then wariness. Closed-door meetings meant bad news.

Rivera gestured to the data on her screen. "You've seen Omar's survey results?"

"The cavity. Yeah." Alexis studied the seismic profile. "That's not natural."

"No. It's not." Rivera pulled up the corporate communications. "Earth wants drilling resumed immediately. They're threatening to pull funding if we don't meet production targets."

"We can't drill. Not until we know what's down there."

"I agree. But corporate doesn't care about what's down there. They care about water extraction rates and shareholder value." Rivera leaned back in her chair. "I need your honest assessment. How long can the colony operate on current water reserves if we don't resume drilling?"

Alexis pulled out her tablet and ran the calculations. "With the recycling system at reduced capacity? Four months. Maybe five if we implement strict rationing."

"And if corporate cuts funding?"

"Then we're on the next transport home, and Mars stays empty for another decade."

Rivera nodded. She'd reached the same conclusion. The colony existed at corporate's pleasure. The moment they stopped being profitable, the money disappeared.

"Here's the problem," Rivera said. "If we drill into that cavity and something goes wrong, we could destroy whatever's down there. Potentially the most significant discovery in human history. But if we don't drill, corporate shuts us down, and we never find out what it is anyway."

"Rock and a hard place."

"Exactly." Rivera pulled up a new schematic. "So I'm proposing a compromise. We drill, but not straight down. We angle the bore to approach the cavity from the side. Slower, more expensive, but it gives us a chance to study what we're dealing with before we breach it."

Alexis studied the plan. "This'll take twice as long. Corporate will notice."

"Let me worry about corporate. You worry about making sure we don't crack open something we can't handle."

"I'll need Omar's full survey data. And Chen's help with the drill recalibration."

"You'll have both. This stays senior staff only until we know more."

Alexis met her eyes. "You really think there's something alive down there?"

Rivera thought about the magnetic pulse. The heat signature. The liquid water that shouldn't exist.

"I think we're standing on top of something that's been waiting a very long time to be found," she said. "And I'd rather not wake it up by accident."

After Alexis left, Rivera pulled up the colony's personnel files. Thirty-seven people, each one a specialist, each one essential. She'd hand-picked this crew. Trained with them. Earned their trust.

Now she was making decisions that could get them all killed. Or get them sent home with nothing to show for six months of brutal work.

Her terminal chimed. Incoming transmission from Earth. She pulled it up expecting more corporate pressure.

Instead, it was Director Kaufman. Her direct superior at the Colonial Authority. The message was flagged priority-encrypted.

Rivera keyed her biometric lock and opened it.

Kaufman's face filled the screen—stern, weathered, unreadable.

"Commander Rivera. By now you've received corporate's demands regarding drilling operations. Ignore them. I'm sending separate authorization under Colonial Authority oversight. You have full discretion to investigate the subsurface anomaly using whatever methods you deem necessary. Corporate will be informed that their interference is in violation of Article Seven of the Mars Settlement Charter—priority of scientific discovery over commercial exploitation. They won't like it, but they'll comply."

Rivera felt something loosen in her chest. She wasn't alone.

Kaufman continued: "Your preliminary data suggests something significant. Possibly unprecedented. I want daily reports, full documentation, and absolute discretion. If this is what I think it is, we can't afford corporate politics contaminating first contact protocols. You have three months before the next supply window. Use them wisely. Kaufman out."

The message ended. Rivera sat back and let herself breathe.

Three months. Resources. Authority.

A chance to do this right.

She keyed the senior staff channel. "All department heads to the conference room. Immediate briefing."

They assembled within minutes—Alexis, Omar, Chen, Yuki, and Dr. Patel from medical. The colony's leadership. The people she trusted with truth.

Rivera pulled up the seismic data on the main screen.

"We're going to drill," she said. "But first, we're going to understand what we're drilling into. Omar, I want continuous monitoring. Every instrument we have pointed at that cavity. Alexis, work with Chen on the angled approach. We breach the cavity wall from the side, controlled and careful. Yuki, Patel—prepare contamination protocols. If there's any kind of biological element, we can't risk exposure."

"What about corporate?" Chen asked.

"Handled. We have backing from the Colonial Authority." Rivera met each person's eyes. "This is what we came here for. Not water extraction. Not proving Mars is profitable. We came to explore. To discover. To expand human knowledge. And we've found something that might rewrite everything we thought we knew about this planet."

Omar pulled up his isotope analysis. "The carbon-fourteen levels suggest recent biological activity. Within the last few decades. On a planet that's been dead for billions of years."

"Unless it wasn't dead," Alexis said quietly. "Unless it was just sleeping."

The room fell silent.

"We proceed carefully," Rivera said. "Document everything. And we do not—I repeat, do not—compromise whatever's down there for the sake of speed or profit. Clear?"

Affirmatives around the table.

"Good. Get to work. We breach in two weeks."

They filed out, energy crackling in their movements. This was what explorers lived for—the moment when routine became discovery.

Rivera pulled up Kaufman's message again. Watched his face, looking for subtext. The Colonial Authority had been fighting corporate interests for years. This was ammunition in that war—proof that Mars held more value than quarterly earnings reports.

But it was also risk. If they breached the cavity and found nothing, corporate would use it as evidence of "wasteful scientific overreach." Funding would dry up. The colony would close.

And if they found something? If the cavity contained actual evidence of Martian life?

Then everything changed.

Rivera looked out the viewport at the rusty landscape. Barren. Hostile. Beautiful in its desolation.

Somewhere beneath her feet, something pulsed at point-eight-seven hertz.

In two weeks, they'd know what it was.

She pulled up the mission clock. Six months, fourteen days since touchdown. Every day had been struggle—equipment failures, resource shortages, the constant grinding pressure of survival.

But this made it worth it.

Rivera opened a new file and started her report to Kaufman. Detailed. Precise. Honest about the risks and the possibilities.

They were going to drill into the unknown.

And whatever they found, humanity would never look at Mars the same way again.
