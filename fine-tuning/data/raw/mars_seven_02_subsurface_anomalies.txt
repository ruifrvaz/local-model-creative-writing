Dr. Omar Hassan crouched at the edge of the borehole, his helmet lamp cutting through the Martian darkness. The sediment core lay in its containment tube, five meters of compressed history waiting to be read.

"I'm bringing it up," he said into the comm.

Yuki's voice crackled back. "Copy that. We've got the lab prepped."

Hassan triggered the winch. The cable went taut, and the core began its slow ascent from the subsurface. Forty meters down, through layers of regolith and ancient bedrock, into the anomaly his ground-penetrating radar had detected three days ago.

The anomaly that shouldn't exist.

Mars was dead. Had been for three billion years. Its magnetic field had collapsed, its atmosphere had bled away, and anything that might have once lived here had long since turned to dust.

But the radar didn't lie. And neither did the seismic readings.

Something down there was different.

The core reached the surface. Hassan disconnected the tube and carried it to the rover, moving carefully in the low gravity. The sun was setting, painting the landscape in shades of rust and amber. Beautiful, in a desolate way.

Back at the habitat, he sealed the core in the analysis chamber and began the scan. Layer by layer, the imaging software peeled back time.

Regolith. Expected.

Compressed dust. Expected.

Ancient lava flow. Expected.

And then, at thirty-eight meters: a void.

Hassan leaned closer. Not just a void—a cavity. Perfectly spherical, approximately two meters in diameter, surrounded by compressed sediment that showed signs of thermal alteration.

"Yuki, are you seeing this?"

She appeared beside him, still in her environmental suit from the external repairs. "That's not natural."

"No, it's not." Hassan ran a composition analysis. The surrounding rock showed elevated levels of organic compounds. Trace hydrocarbons. And something else—complex molecules that didn't match any Martian mineralogy in the database.

"Could it be a meteorite impact?" Yuki asked.

"Wrong shape. Impacts create cones, not spheres." Hassan enhanced the image. The cavity walls were smooth, almost polished. "This looks artificial."

"Artificial? You mean like—"

"I mean something made this. Deliberately." Hassan pulled up the dating analysis. "And it's old. Three point two billion years, give or take a hundred million."

Yuki went quiet. Hassan knew what she was thinking. The same thing he'd been trying not to think since the radar first pinged.

"We need to tell Rivera," she said.

"And say what? That I found a hole in the ground that might be alien archaeology?" Hassan shook his head. "She'll think I've been breathing too much recycled air."

"Then show her the data. Let her draw her own conclusions."

Hassan saved the analysis and copied it to his personal drive. Yuki was right. This was too big to sit on.

But a part of him wanted to dig deeper first. To be sure. Because if he was wrong, he'd be the geologist who cried alien. And if he was right...

If he was right, everything changed.

"I want to take another core," he said. "Fifty meters this time, right next to the first borehole. If there's a pattern, we'll find it."

"Omar, this is beyond our mandate. We're supposed to be surveying for water ice, not looking for—" Yuki gestured at the image. "Whatever this is."

"The two aren't mutually exclusive. If there's a cavity down there, it might explain the water vapor readings we've been getting." Hassan pulled up the atmospheric analysis from last week. "Look. Trace H2O in the subsurface atmosphere, right over this location. I thought it was instrument error."

"But if there's a cavity, and it's connected to a deeper aquifer—"

"Then we might have found our water source. And explained the anomaly in one go." Hassan met her eyes. "Two days. Give me two days to confirm the readings. If it's nothing, we report it as a geological curiosity and move on."

Yuki looked at the image again. Hassan could see the scientist in her warring with the engineer. Discovery versus protocol.

"Two days," she said finally. "But if you find anything else strange, we go straight to Rivera. Deal?"

"Deal."

She left him alone in the lab. Hassan turned back to the core analysis, his mind already racing ahead to the next borehole, the next scan, the next piece of the puzzle.

Three point two billion years ago, Mars had been different. Warmer. Wetter. Maybe even habitable.

What had made that cavity?

And more importantly: was it still down there?

Hassan pulled up the drilling schedule. The equipment was available tomorrow afternoon. He could have a new core by evening, results by midnight.

His hand hesitated over the keyboard. Protocol said he should file a preliminary report. Let Rivera decide whether to proceed.

But protocol also said to investigate all anomalous readings. And this was definitely anomalous.

Hassan authorized the drilling permit and sent it through standard channels. No special flags, no urgent requests. Just another geological survey in an ongoing study.

If anyone looked too closely, they'd see it was right next to yesterday's borehole. But who looked closely at drilling permits?

He shut down the analysis chamber and headed for his quarters. Tomorrow would be a long day.

But as he walked through the darkened corridors, Hassan couldn't shake the image of that perfect sphere. Too perfect. Too deliberate.

Mars kept its secrets well.

Maybe it was time to start uncovering them.

In his quarters, Hassan pulled up the historical records of Mars exploration. Decades of probes and rovers and eventually human missions, all searching for signs of past life.

They'd found traces. Organic molecules. Seasonal methane emissions. Ancient riverbeds. All the pieces of a puzzle that suggested Mars had once been alive.

But never proof. Never the smoking gun that said life had existed here.

What if it still did?

Hassan opened his personal files and began drafting a paper. Not for publication—not yet. Just organizing his thoughts, documenting his findings, preparing for whatever came next.

The sphere in the rock. The organic compounds. The water vapor.

Pieces of a puzzle three billion years in the making.

And Omar Hassan, geologist, was going to solve it.

Or die trying.

Not literally, he hoped. But Mars had a way of making dramatic metaphors into literal truths.

He worked until exhaustion dragged him to sleep, his dreams filled with spheres and ancient waters and things that moved in Martian darkness.

When the alarm woke him six hours later, Hassan's first thought was of the borehole.

His second thought was: what if I'm not ready for what I find?

He pushed the thought away and reached for his suit.

Mars was waiting.

And so were its secrets.
