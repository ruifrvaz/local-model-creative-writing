The quantum communication array hummed with barely contained power. Patel had rigged it to handle the anomaly's signal—a technical feat that should've been impossible with their limited equipment.

"I'm isolating the core message structure," he said, fingers flying across holographic interfaces. "It's using a base-12 mathematical system. Probably reflective of its origin biology or computational architecture."

Elena watched the data cascade across screens. "Can you decode it?"

"I'm trying. The language is consistent with what we'd expect from an advanced intelligence—symbolic, self-referential, with embedded error correction." Patel pulled up a translation matrix. "But there's something else. Emotional context markers."

"It has emotions?"

"Or it's trying to communicate with beings that do." Patel highlighted a repeating sequence. "This pattern appears in every message. Could be a greeting. Could be a warning. Could be a name."

Marcus leaned over the console. "What if it's asking us something?"

"Like what?"

"Like who we are. Where we come from. Why we're here." Marcus gestured at the signal stream. "First contact protocols always start with establishing mutual understanding."

Elena considered this. "Patel, send our basic information. Solar system coordinates, human biology basics, our technological level."

"That's risky, Captain. We're showing our hand."

"It already knows most of that. The question is whether we're willing to be honest." Elena activated her command override. "Send it."

The transmission went out—a carefully packaged summary of humanity's existence, encoded in the anomaly's mathematical language.

The response was immediate and overwhelming. Data flooded their systems—so much information that Patel had to throttle the receivers to prevent overload.

"What is all this?" Marcus asked.

Patel worked frantically to process the incoming stream. "Star charts. Biological schematics. Historical records." His eyes widened. "Captain, it's showing us itself. Its civilization, its history, its technology."

Images formed on the displays. Worlds that shouldn't exist. Structures that defied physics. Beings of light and mathematics, evolved beyond flesh.

"How old is this civilization?" Elena breathed.

"The timestamps..." Patel did calculations. "If I'm reading this right, they achieved space flight before Earth had multicellular life."

"Impossible."

"Look at the data."

Elena did. Ancient beyond comprehension. Powerful beyond measure. And yet here it was, talking to them. To a species barely out of its gravity well, still fighting wars over resources and ideology.

"Why?" she said aloud. "Why contact us?"

The answer came not in words, but in a final image. The Meridian. The crew. Humanity.

And beneath it, a question rendered in pure mathematics: *Are you ready?*

Elena stared at the screen. Ready for what?

"Captain," Patel said quietly. "I think we just received an invitation."

"To what?"

"I don't know. But whatever it is, it's bigger than us. Bigger than anything humanity has ever encountered."

Elena thought of Phobos. Of the three hundred dead. Of her sister's face in the photo by her bunk.

"Send a response," she said. "Tell them... tell them we need to understand what happened to Phobos first."

"Captain—"

"Do it."

The message went out. And this time, the silence that followed felt different. Waiting. Anticipating.

Understanding.
