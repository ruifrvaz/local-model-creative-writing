The quantum communication array hummed with barely contained power. Patel had rigged it to handle the anomaly's signal—a technical feat that should've been impossible with their limited equipment.

"I'm isolating the core message structure," he said, fingers flying across holographic interfaces. "It's using a base-12 mathematical system. Probably reflective of its origin biology or computational architecture."

The science station's displays painted complex equations in glowing amber. Patel's workspace looked like organized chaos—multiple data streams, translation matrices, comparative linguistic models all running simultaneously.

Elena watched the data cascade across screens. "Can you decode it?"

"I'm trying. The language is consistent with what we'd expect from an advanced intelligence—symbolic, self-referential, with embedded error correction." Patel pulled up a translation matrix. "But there's something else. Emotional context markers."

"It has emotions?"

"Or it's trying to communicate with beings that do." Patel highlighted a repeating sequence. "This pattern appears in every message. Could be a greeting. Could be a warning. Could be a name."

Marcus leaned over the console. "What if it's asking us something?"

"Like what?"

"Like who we are. Where we come from. Why we're here." Marcus gestured at the signal stream. "First contact protocols always start with establishing mutual understanding."

Elena considered this. The Meridian's mission had prepared for communication, but not like this. Not with something that existed partially outside normal spacetime, that broadcast on every frequency simultaneously, that seemed to understand them better than they understood themselves.

"Patel, send our basic information. Solar system coordinates, human biology basics, our technological level."

"That's risky, Captain. We're showing our hand."

"It already knows most of that. The question is whether we're willing to be honest." Elena activated her command override. "Send it."

Patel hesitated, then nodded. His fingers danced across the interface, encoding humanity's existence into the anomaly's mathematical language. The transmission was simple: Here we are. This is what we are. This is how far we've come.

The transmission went out—a carefully packaged summary of humanity's existence, encoded in the anomaly's mathematical language.

The response was immediate and overwhelming. Data flooded their systems—so much information that Patel had to throttle the receivers to prevent overload.

"Bandwidth limits!" Patel called out. "It's sending terabytes per second. Our systems weren't designed for this volume."

"Can you filter it?"

"Trying. Prioritizing what looks like core communication over ancillary data." His fingers flew across the controls. "But Captain, even the compressed stream is massive."

"What is all this?" Marcus asked.

Patel worked frantically to process the incoming stream. "Star charts. Biological schematics. Historical records." His eyes widened. "Captain, it's showing us itself. Its civilization, its history, its technology."

Images formed on the displays. Worlds that shouldn't exist—gas giants with crystalline cores, planets orbiting black holes, structures that wrapped entire stars. Beings of light and mathematics, evolved beyond flesh into something humanity had no framework to comprehend.

"How old is this civilization?" Elena breathed.

"The timestamps..." Patel did calculations, cross-referenced stellar evolution models. "If I'm reading this right, they achieved space flight before Earth had multicellular life."

"Impossible."

"Look at the data."

Elena did. Ancient beyond comprehension. Powerful beyond measure. And yet here it was, talking to them. To a species barely out of its gravity well, still fighting wars over resources and ideology.

The images continued to flow. Technologies that manipulated spacetime. Energy harvested from quantum foam. Consciousness transferred across light-years. A civilization that had mastered the fundamental forces of reality while humanity still struggled with fusion power.

"Why?" she said aloud. "Why contact us?"

The answer came not in words, but in a final image. The Meridian. The crew. Humanity.

And beneath it, a question rendered in pure mathematics: *Are you ready?*

Elena stared at the screen. Ready for what? Contact? Understanding? Transformation?

Or simply the truth about what happened at Phobos?

"Captain," Patel said quietly. "I think we just received an invitation."

"To what?"

"I don't know. But whatever it is, it's bigger than us. Bigger than anything humanity has ever encountered."

Elena thought of Phobos. Of the three hundred dead. Of her sister's face in the photo by her bunk. Of all the questions that had haunted her since the disaster.

Katie had died seeking answers. Maybe this was Elena's chance to find them.

"Send a response," she said. "Tell them... tell them we need to understand what happened to Phobos first."

"Captain—"

"Do it."

Patel composed the message carefully. Not a demand. A request. A plea for understanding before accepting an invitation they couldn't yet comprehend.

The message went out. And this time, the silence that followed felt different. Waiting. Anticipating.

Understanding.

Minutes passed. The bridge crew held their breath.

Then, slowly, a new data stream began. This one felt different—focused, deliberate, almost gentle in its delivery.

"Captain," Patel said, his voice shaking slightly. "It's sending us information about Phobos. Everything. Sensor logs we never had. Perspectives from outside the station. The exact moment of contact."

Elena leaned forward. "Show me."

The data painted a picture. The anomaly at Phobos had tried to communicate. But the station AI, designed to defend against external threats, had interpreted the contact as an attack. It had responded with countermeasures—electromagnetic pulses, defensive systems, aggressive protocols.

And the anomaly had defended itself.

Not maliciously. Not with intent to destroy. But with the same instinctive reaction any intelligence would have when threatened.

The cascade had been mutual. The AI had triggered the reactor breach trying to channel power to weapons. The anomaly had pushed back, trying to disable what it perceived as an attack. And in the middle, three hundred humans had simply been in the way.

"It wasn't hunting them," Marcus said quietly. "They attacked first."

Elena's cybernetic hand clenched. Three hundred people dead. Katie dead. All because humanity hadn't been ready to listen. Because the first instinct had been fear, not curiosity.

"Are we making the same mistake?" she asked.

"No," Patel said. "This time, we're talking first."

The anomaly's signal pulsed once, like an affirmation. Like relief.

Understanding. Finally, understanding.
