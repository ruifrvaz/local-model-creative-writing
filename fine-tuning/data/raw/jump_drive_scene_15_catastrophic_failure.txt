Dr. Kenji Yamamoto reviewed the incident report and felt the mathematical elegance of disaster. Jump Ship Aurora. Alcubierre field generator malfunction. Bubble collapse asymmetry exceeding all safety parameters.

Three crew members. Three different outcomes.

Pilot: Catastrophic temporal fragmentation. Consciousness shattered across incompatible timeframes.
Engineer: Partial adaptation. Recovering in medical bay.
Navigator: Unaffected. Genetic markers predicting low temporal sensitivity.

"What caused the malfunction?" Admiral Kowalski asked via secure channel.

"Field emitter degradation. Maintenance protocols didn't catch the microscopic fractures in the exotic matter containment." Kenji pulled up the technical analysis. "The bubble collapsed unevenly. Created temporal gradient ten times steeper than normal jumps."

"Pilot status?"

"Lieutenant Chen—not Sarah, different Chen, David Chen—his consciousness fragmented beyond reconsolidation. He exists across approximately forty different temporal states simultaneously. No coherent awareness. Neural activity present but completely desynchronized."

"Prognosis?"

"Unknown. This is beyond anything we've seen. Even Sarah maintains coherent consciousness despite temporal omniscience. David is experiencing temporal fragmentation without the neural adaptation that allows functionality."

Kowalski pulled up the pilot roster. "We've completed three thousand successful jumps. One catastrophic malfunction. That's a point-zero-three percent failure rate. Acceptable by most standards."

"Not acceptable to David Chen."

"Lieutenant Chen volunteered knowing the risks. Every pilot does."

"The risks just increased by an order of magnitude. Field degradation was supposed to be detectable. Our safety protocols failed."

"Then improve the protocols. But don't ground the program. We have two hundred commercial vessels dependent on FTL capability. Shutting down operations would cost billions and strand colonists on Mars."

Kenji felt the familiar weight of strategic necessity crushing ethical concerns. They'd built civilization around FTL travel. Colonies depended on three-second transits instead of six-month voyages. Economy depended on instantaneous interplanetary transport.

All built on technology that could shatter human consciousness if anything went wrong.

"I want mandatory field inspections before every jump. Not automated scans. Physical inspection by qualified technicians."

"That will slow operations significantly."

"That will prevent more pilots from ending up like David Chen."

Kowalski considered. "Implement enhanced inspection protocols. But keep the program running. We can't afford shutdowns."

The new protocols began immediately. Every jump ship underwent detailed field emitter inspection. Operations slowed by forty percent. Costs increased accordingly.

Three weeks later, inspections caught microfractures in six different vessels. All would have failed catastrophically within fifty jumps.

The inspection program had prevented six David Chens. Maybe more.

Kenji visited David in the medical facility. The lieutenant lay connected to neural monitoring equipment showing patterns that shouldn't exist. His consciousness fragmented across forty temporal states, none coherent enough for awareness.

"Can we consolidate his temporal states?" Dr. Aisha Mbara asked.

"Unknown. Sarah exists across all moments but maintains coherent consciousness because her neural structures adapted to support that. David's brain fragmented without adapting. He's experiencing forty different moments but can't process any of them coherently."

"So he's aware but not conscious?"

"He's something worse. Conscious but scattered across incompatible awareness states. Each temporal fragment contains partial consciousness that can't communicate with the others."

Aisha pulled up the neural scans. "What if we use selective field generators? Try to consolidate his consciousness artificially?"

"The field parameters would have to be incredibly precise. And we'd need to know which temporal state to consolidate around. His past? His present? Some future state he's experiencing?"

"Could we ask Sarah? She perceives probable futures. Maybe she can see which consolidation would work."

They brought Sarah to David's medical bay. She stood at the edge of her portable field generator and experienced David's fragmentation across multiple probability waves.

"He's scattered," she said quietly. "Forty-three discrete temporal states, each containing partial consciousness. No dominant state. No natural consolidation point."

"Can we create one?"

"You'd have to choose which moment becomes primary. Which temporal state gets to be 'real' David while the others fade. That's not medical decision. That's philosophical."

Kenji looked at the fragmented consciousness readings. David existed in forty-three moments. Each one equally real. Each one containing part of who he'd been.

Choosing one meant erasing forty-two others.

"What does David want?" Aisha asked.

"He wants everything. And nothing. Simultaneously across all states." Sarah pulled up probability distributions. "In sixty-eight percent of futures, you attempt consolidation and fail. He remains fragmented indefinitely. In twenty-three percent, consolidation succeeds but the David who emerges isn't the same person. In nine percent, consolidation kills him entirely."

"And the alternative?"

"Maintain his fragmented state. Keep him alive across forty-three moments. Hope that eventually his neural tissue adapts enough to allow partial coherence."

"How long would that take?"

"Unknown. Possibly years. Possibly never. His fragmentation is more severe than any adaptation case we've studied."

Kenji felt the impossible choice crystallize. Attempt consolidation with low success probability. Or maintain fragmentation hoping for eventual natural adaptation.

Either way, David Chen was gone. The person who'd volunteered for FTL operations existed only as scattered fragments across incompatible moments.

"I'm documenting this as catastrophic failure requiring program modifications," Kenji told Kowalski. "Enhanced inspection isn't enough. We need redundant safety systems. Multiple failure modes. Protection against field degradation we haven't imagined yet."

"That will be expensive."

"David Chen is experiencing forty-three different conscious states simultaneously without coherent integration. Expensive is acceptable."

The safety overhaul began. Redundant field emitters. Real-time degradation monitoring. Automatic abort protocols if bubble asymmetry exceeded safe parameters. Every jump ship underwent complete system replacement.

Costs escalated. Operations slowed further. Commercial carriers complained about delays and expenses.

Kenji didn't care. They'd built FTL travel on the backs of pilots willing to risk temporal fragmentation. The least they could do was minimize those risks.

Six months later, the enhanced safety systems prevented another catastrophic malfunction. Field emitter failure detected mid-jump. Automatic abort. Bubble collapsed under controlled parameters.

Pilot experienced moderate temporal disorientation. Recovered within twenty-four hours. Returned to active duty.

Not catastrophic fragmentation. Not forty-three scattered consciousness states. Just temporary disorientation and successful adaptation.

The safety systems worked.

David Chen remained fragmented. Dr. Mbara tried three different consolidation approaches. All failed. His consciousness stayed scattered across incompatible temporal states.

Eventually, they stopped trying. Kept him on life support. Monitored his neural activity. Hoped his brain would adapt naturally.

Years passed. David existed across forty-three moments. Unable to consolidate. Unable to die. Unable to communicate coherently.

A warning. A cautionary tale. A reminder that FTL travel demanded prices beyond simple mathematics of success and failure.

Sarah visited him sometimes. Stood at the edge of her field generator experiencing his fragmented consciousness across probability waves.

"I'm sorry," she said, though David couldn't hear coherently. "You volunteered knowing the risks. But the risks multiplied beyond prediction. Beyond fairness."

David's neural monitors showed scattered patterns. Forty-three different awareness states. None coherent. All equally real.

Sarah experienced his fragmentation across her own temporal omniscience. Felt the horror of consciousness without integration. Of existing across incompatible moments without the adaptation that allowed functionality.

She'd survived temporal fragmentation by adapting. David had fragmented without adaptation. The difference was genetic luck and field parameters beyond anyone's control.

"We'll keep trying," Sarah promised across timeframes. "Keep searching for consolidation methods. Keep hoping your neural tissue finds coherence."

She knew the probability was low. She existed across all futures. In most, David remained fragmented until biological death.

But in some futures—low probability but non-zero—breakthrough consolidation techniques emerged. David reconsolidated. Became coherent. Lived.

Those futures were worth hoping for.

Even if they were unlikely.

Even if David existed across forty-three moments unable to hope for himself.

Sarah left the medical bay and returned to her three-meter cage.

The price of FTL travel included catastrophes. Included David Chen fragmented beyond recovery. Included all the pilots who'd adapted and all who'd failed.

Progress demanded sacrifice.

Some sacrifices were voluntary.

Some were catastrophic.

All were permanent.

Sarah experienced them across all moments simultaneously.

And continued anyway.

Because the alternative was abandoning humanity's expansion.

And that cost was higher than individual suffering.

Even David's.

Even hers.

The math was brutal.

But the mission continued.

Across all moments.

Forever.
