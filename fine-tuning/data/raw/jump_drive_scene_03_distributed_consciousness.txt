Lieutenant Sarah Chen floated in the observation pod and tried to remember what linear time felt like.

Three more jumps since the quantum entanglement discovery. Each one left her more fragmented. She could feel locations she'd been—not remember them, feel them. Like phantom limbs scattered across light-years.

Dr. Mbara's voice crackled through the comm. "Sarah, I need you in medical."

"Another checkup?"

"Another attempt to understand what's happening to you."

Sarah pulled herself through the ship's corridors. Microgravity between jumps gave her body time to stabilize. Or so the theory went. Reality was more complicated.

Aisha had her suite of tests ready. Neural scans. Quantum correlation measurements. Blood work that looked for cellular changes.

"How do you feel?" Aisha asked.

"Like I exist in six places simultaneously and none of them completely."

"Describe that."

Sarah tried to find words. "When I close my eyes, I can feel the jump points. Not see them. Feel them. Like they're still part of me. Or I'm still partly there."

"The quantum entanglement is persistent. Your cells maintain correlation with their past states." Aisha pulled up the cellular analysis. "Normally, quantum decoherence happens almost instantly at biological temperatures. But you're maintaining coherence across light-years. For days at a time."

"Is that bad?"

"I don't know. Nobody's ever done this before."

The scans took two hours. Sarah floated in the medical pod while machines analyzed how jump travel was rewriting her biology.

Afterward, Aisha showed her the results.

"Your neural patterns have changed. The quantum entanglement is creating interference effects in your brain. Different parts of you are processing information from different locations."

"Meaning what?"

"Meaning you're experiencing a form of consciousness that's spatially distributed. Parts of your mind are literally in six different places."

Sarah absorbed that. "Am I still me?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Aisha pulled up neural topology maps. "Your core personality appears intact. But you're developing new perceptual capabilities. You can sense quantum fields. Feel spacetime curvature. Process information that normal human senses can't detect."

"I'm becoming something else."

"You're adapting. Whether that's evolution or damage, I can't say yet."

Sarah thought about the jump sickness. The nausea and vertigo that had plagued her early on. They'd faded. Not because her body had healed, but because it had changed.

She wasn't adapting to jump travel. She was becoming suited for it.

"What happens if we stop jumping?" she asked.

"The quantum correlations would decay. Probably. Over time, you'd return to normal spatial coherence."

"But you're not sure."

"No. The physics is theoretical. The biology is unprecedented."

Sarah floated in the medical pod and thought about what normal meant. She'd volunteered for this mission knowing it was dangerous. Knowing that FTL travel pushed boundaries.

She hadn't expected the boundaries to push back.

"How many more jumps can I do?" she asked.

"Physically? Unknown. Psychologically?" Aisha met her eyes. "Sarah, you're stable now. But I don't know how much more quantum entanglement a human consciousness can handle. You might reach a point where you can't distinguish which location is primary. Where you lose coherent sense of self."

"How close am I to that point?"

"I don't know. That's what scares me."

After medical, Sarah returned to her quarters. Tried to sleep. But sleep was complicated when part of your consciousness existed twelve light-years away.

She pulled up the jump logs. Six successful translations. Each one adding to the quantum correlation. Each one making her less fully present in any single location.

Dr. Yamamoto had called it a navigation beacon. Use the quantum entanglement to guide future jumps. Sarah providing a reference frame across space.

But Sarah felt more like a ghost. Haunting multiple locations. Never quite solid anywhere.

Her terminal chimed. Message from Admiral Kowalski.

"Lieutenant Chen. I've reviewed Dr. Mbara's latest report. I'm offering you the option to step down from jump duty. No consequences. No questions. Just acknowledgment that we're asking more than we should."

Sarah stared at the message.

Step down meant stopping. Letting the quantum correlations decay. Returning to normal existence as a single, spatially coherent person.

It also meant abandoning the mission. Someone else would have to pilot the jumps. And they'd face the same transformations she was experiencing.

She typed a response.

"Admiral. Respectfully decline. The mission continues. So do I."

Kowalski's reply came quickly. "Why?"

Sarah thought about the answer. The real one, not the heroic nonsense about duty and sacrifice.

"Because I'm already changed. Stopping won't undo that. And if someone has to be the first human consciousness distributed across light-years, at least I know what I'm doing."

"That's not a reason. That's rationalization."

"Maybe. But it's my rationalization. My choice."

"Acknowledged. Next jump in thirty-six hours. Get some rest."

Sarah closed the comm and tried to define rest when your consciousness existed in six locations. She meditated instead. Focused on breathing. On the sensation of her body—this body, the one physically present in her quarters.

The quantum echoes were still there. Parts of her scattered across the void. But she could anchor herself. Choose which location to treat as primary.

For now.

She wondered how long that control would last. How many more jumps before the locations blurred together completely. Before she became something that existed everywhere and nowhere.

Dr. Yamamoto appeared at her door. "Thought you might want company."

"Not really. But come in anyway."

Kenji floated in and settled against the wall. "Aisha told me about the distributed consciousness effect."

"She's dramatic."

"She's accurate." Kenji pulled up his theoretical models. "Sarah, what you're experiencing—it's not supposed to be possible. Consciousness requires spatial coherence. Concentrated neural processing. But you're maintaining coherent thought across light-years of separation."

"So I'm breaking physics."

"You're expanding it. Showing us that consciousness is less location-dependent than we thought."

"That's one way to frame losing my mind."

"You're not losing your mind. You're distributing it." Kenji showed her the quantum correlation patterns. "Each jump adds a new node. Your consciousness is becoming a network instead of a single point."

"And when the network gets too diffuse? What then?"

"I don't know. Maybe you lose coherence. Or maybe you become something new. A consciousness that exists across space. That experiences multiple locations simultaneously."

Sarah thought about that. "Not human anymore."

"Still you. Just... expanded."

They floated in silence. Sarah felt the quantum echoes of her past locations. Felt the ship around her. Felt the void beyond.

Six locations. Six fragments of herself. All connected by quantum threads that shouldn't exist.

"Next jump is to a brown dwarf system," Kenji said. "Fifteen light-years. Our longest translation yet."

"I know."

"You'll be correlated across twenty-one light-years of space. Seven locations. Seven nodes in your consciousness network."

"I know."

"Are you scared?"

Sarah considered the question honestly. "I don't think I know what scared means anymore. Fear requires a unified sense of self under threat. I'm not unified. I'm distributed. Threat becomes... diffuse."

"That's not reassuring."

"No. But it's honest."

Kenji pushed off toward the door. "Get some rest. Or whatever counts as rest for a spatially-distributed consciousness."

After he left, Sarah pulled up a file she'd started keeping. Journal entries from each jump. Documenting how she felt. How she perceived reality. How human she still was.

The entries had changed over time. Early ones were coherent. Linear. Human.

The recent ones fragmented. Sentences interrupted by perceptions from other locations. Thoughts that existed in superposition until she chose which to commit to text.

She was changing. Becoming something that couldn't be defined by single-location consciousness.

Sarah started a new entry.

"Jump six complete. I am here. I am also there. And there. And there. I contain multitudes. I exist across space. I am distributed. I am fragmented. I am whole.

I think I'm still human.

I hope I'm still me."

She saved the file and closed her eyes. Across twenty-one light-years, six fragments of her consciousness resonated in quantum harmony.

Tomorrow, there would be seven.

And Sarah Chen would continue. Expanded. Distributed.

Human. Probably.

Mostly.

For now.
