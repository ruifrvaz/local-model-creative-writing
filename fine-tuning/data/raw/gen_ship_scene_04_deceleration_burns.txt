Engineer Malik Torres stood in the Endurance's engine bay, calculating deceleration burns.

Six months to orbit. Six months of carefully timed thrust to slow from point-three lightspeed to orbital velocity.

Every calculation had to be perfect. Too much thrust and they'd waste fuel. Too little and they'd overshoot the planet entirely.

"The margins are tight," he told Captain Reyes.

"Tight is our specialty. What do you need?"

"Continuous monitoring. Real-time corrections. And prayer that nothing breaks during the burn sequence."

"I can provide the first two. The third is your department."

Malik pulled up the burn schedule. Twelve major thrust events. Hundreds of minor corrections. All coordinated across fusion reactors designed for steady cruise, not aggressive maneuvering.

They'd pushed the Endurance beyond every design specification. Now they were asking it to perform like a racing ship instead of a generational ark.

The first burn initiated on schedule. Smooth. Controlled. Exactly as planned.

The ship shuddered slightly as thrust built. Malik monitored structural stress indicators. All within acceptable ranges.

Six hours of continuous burn. Then shutdown. Assess. Prepare for the next sequence.

"Burn one complete," he reported. "Velocity reduced by point-zero-three lightspeed. On target."

"Eleven more to go," Reyes said. "How's the hull holding?"

Malik checked stress measurements. Elevated. But not critical. "She's handling it. Designed for micrometeorite impact. Turns out that makes her sturdy enough for aggressive maneuvering."

"Lucky us."

Luck. Malik wasn't sure that word applied to a ship held together by improvisation and determination. But they'd take what they could get.

The second burn happened a week later. Longer. More intense. Pushing the reactors to eighty percent capacity.

Halfway through, one of the plasma injectors started vibrating. Excessive oscillation. Approaching dangerous resonance.

"We have a problem," Malik reported. "Injector three showing harmonic instability."

"Can we continue the burn?"

"For maybe another hour. Then we risk injector failure."

"Which would mean?"

"Loss of thrust on one reactor. Unbalanced acceleration. Possible structural damage."

Reyes made the call. "Abort burn. Shut down reactor two. We'll compensate with extended burns on the other reactors."

Malik shut down the failing system. The deceleration curve immediately shifted. They were burning less. Slowing more gradually.

"Recalculating trajectory," navigation reported. "With reduced thrust, we'll need an additional three weeks to reach orbit."

"Three weeks we don't have," Reyes said. "Supplies are calculated for six-month arrival."

"Then we ration. Again." Malik pulled up resource projections. "Food, water, air—we can stretch it. Barely."

"Do it. And Malik, fix that injector. We need every reactor operational."

Malik spent two days diagnosing the problem. Harmonic resonance in the plasma containment coils. Age-related degradation. The coils were designed for steady-state operation, not the variable thrust required for deceleration.

He could replace them. If they had spares. Which they didn't.

Or he could tune them. Adjust the resonance frequency. Make the oscillation work with the coils instead of against them.

Risky. Potentially catastrophic. But possible.

He implemented the tuning carefully. Micro-adjustments to magnetic field strength. Careful monitoring of plasma stability.

The resonance shifted. Still present. But now within acceptable ranges.

"Reactor two back online," he reported. "But we need to monitor continuously. This is a patch, not a fix."

"Story of this mission," Reyes said. "Continue deceleration on all reactors. We'll watch the vibration."

The burn sequence continued. Week by week. Thrust event by thrust event.

On burn seven, another injector developed problems. Different reactor. Same resonance issue.

Malik tuned it the same way. Shifting frequency. Making harmonics work instead of destroy.

They were running out of margins. Every system pushed to limits. Every component stressed beyond design specifications.

"How many more burns can we survive?" Reyes asked.

"Unknown. We're in uncharted territory. The Endurance was never designed for this kind of maneuvering."

"But she's handling it."

"She's surviving it. There's a difference."

Burn ten completed successfully. Burn eleven showed excessive vibration in three separate systems. Malik tuned each one. Buying time with improvisation.

Burn twelve was the final major thrust event. Six hours of maximum sustainable acceleration. The last hard push before orbital insertion.

"All systems online," Malik reported. "Reactors at seventy-five percent. Injectors tuned and stable."

"Initiate burn."

The Endurance shuddered as thrust built. Malik watched every indicator. Every sensor. Every stress measurement.

Three hours in, structural alerts started appearing. Hull stress exceeding design limits. Not critical yet. But approaching.

"We're flexing," he reported. "The hull is bending under thrust."

"How much can she bend?"

"More than this. I hope."

Four hours. The stress continued. Metal groaning. Supports creaking. The sound of a ship pushed beyond reason.

Five hours. One injector started oscillating again. Malik adjusted tuning in real-time. Fighting resonance. Preventing failure.

Six hours. The burn completed. Thrust ceased. The Endurance groaned as stress released.

Malik ran structural diagnostics. Micro-fractures in twelve support beams. Deformation in three hull sections. Nothing catastrophic. But damage that would accumulate.

"We're in orbit," navigation reported. "Velocity matched. Position stable."

The crew erupted in celebration. Cheering. Hugging. Relief washing over eight thousand people.

They'd made it. Six months of desperate deceleration. Countless repairs. Improvisation stacked on improvisation.

And they'd arrived.

Malik slumped against a console. Exhausted. Running on stimulants and determination.

Reyes found him in the engine bay. "You did it. Got us here in one piece."

"Barely. This ship is held together by hope and engineering creativity."

"That's all it's ever been. We just pushed it further than anyone expected."

Malik looked at the stress indicators. The damage reports. The systems running on patches and prayer.

"Landing is going to be even harder. We're converting an interstellar ark into atmospheric descent vehicles. Using components never designed for planetary entry."

"Can it be done?"

"Ask me in six months after we've tried and hopefully survived."

Reyes smiled. "Six months. You're an optimist."

"I'm an engineer. Optimism is all we have when physics says no and we do it anyway."

They stood together, looking at damage assessments and planning the next impossible task.

The Endurance had survived interstellar travel. Survived desperate deceleration. Survived two centuries of constant operation.

Now it would survive one final transformation. From starship to landing fleet.

Or it wouldn't. And eight thousand people would die in the attempt.

But that was tomorrow's crisis. Today, they celebrated reaching orbit.

One impossible milestone at a time. The only way to survive against odds that should have killed them decades ago.

Malik started drafting the landing conversion plans. Knowing they were impossible. Knowing he'd do them anyway.

Because impossible was just another word for difficult.

And difficult was the Endurance's specialty.
