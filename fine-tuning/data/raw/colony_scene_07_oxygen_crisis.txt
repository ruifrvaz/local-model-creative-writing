Yuki Tanaka ran the numbers for the third time, hoping they'd change.

They didn't.

The colony's oxygen production was dropping. Not catastrophically. Not yet. But the trend was clear. In six weeks, they'd fall below minimum safe levels.

The greenhouse was the problem. Half the plants had died from the fungal contamination. The survivors were stressed, producing twenty percent less oxygen than normal.

And the antifungal treatments weren't working fast enough.

She pulled up the atmospheric projections. With current oxygen generation, they had forty-two days before rationing became necessary. Sixty days before people started showing hypoxia symptoms.

Commander Rivera needed to know.

Yuki found her in the command module, reviewing supply requisitions.

"Commander, we have an oxygen problem."

Rivera looked up sharply. "How bad?"

"Six weeks until critical. The greenhouse losses are hitting us hard."

Rivera pulled up the atmospheric data. Her expression darkened. "Options?"

"Reduce population. Limit physical activity. Both just delay the problem." Yuki highlighted the real solution. "We need more plants. Fast-growing, high-oxygen producers."

"The next supply ship brings agricultural stock. But that's five weeks away."

"We don't have five weeks. We have four." Yuki had done the math carefully. "And even then, new plants take time to establish. We're looking at eight to ten weeks before they're producing meaningful oxygen."

"So we ration. Reduce activity levels. Everyone stays in their quarters except for essential work."

"That buys us time. Maybe." Yuki pulled up the psychological impact studies. "But prolonged inactivity in confined spaces increases stress. Depression. Conflict."

"I'm aware. But dead from hypoxia is worse than depressed from boredom."

Rivera initiated emergency protocols. Colony-wide announcement. Mandatory activity restrictions. Oxygen conservation measures.

The crew took it well. They were professionals. They understood crisis management.

But Yuki saw the fear in their eyes. Mars had tried to kill them with water contamination. With subsurface instability. With equipment failures.

Now it was trying to suffocate them slowly.

She returned to her lab. There had to be a solution. Some way to boost oxygen production without waiting for new plants.

The algae cultures. The colony used them for water recycling. They produced oxygen as a byproduct, but not much. Maybe five percent of total atmospheric generation.

What if she optimized them? Increased their efficiency?

Yuki pulled up the algae growth parameters. Light intensity. Nutrient concentration. Temperature. pH balance.

She could push them harder. More light meant more photosynthesis. More nutrients meant faster growth.

But it also meant higher energy consumption. And potential culture collapse if the algae were stressed beyond tolerance.

She ran simulations. The optimized cultures could boost oxygen production by thirty percent. Maybe forty if she got lucky.

Enough to buy them time. Maybe enough to survive until the plants recovered.

She presented the plan to Rivera. "It's risky. If the cultures crash, we lose that oxygen source completely."

"Risk of action versus risk of inaction," Rivera said. "Can you monitor the cultures? Catch any problems before catastrophic failure?"

"Yes. But I'll need to dedicate most of my time to it."

"Do it. Assign your other duties to Kwan's team."

Yuki implemented the changes immediately. Increased light levels in the algae tanks. Boosted nutrient feeds. Adjusted pH to optimal ranges.

The cultures responded. Growth rates climbed. Oxygen output increased.

For three days, everything worked perfectly.

On day four, one tank showed stress markers. The algae were dividing too fast, depleting nutrients faster than the automated systems could replace them.

Yuki manually adjusted the feed rate. Crisis averted.

Day seven, another tank started showing pH drift. The algae's rapid metabolism was acidifying the water.

Manual adjustment again. New monitoring protocols.

Day twelve, Yuki realized she hadn't slept more than four hours in the last week.

Dr. Kim found her at the algae tanks, running tests with shaking hands.

"You're going to collapse," Kim said.

"I'm fine."

"You're not. You're showing signs of acute exhaustion." Kim pulled up her medical scanner. "Elevated cortisol. Disrupted circadian rhythms. Cognitive impairment."

"I can handle it."

"For how long? Another week? Two? And then what happens when you pass out and nobody knows how to maintain these cultures?"

Yuki wanted to argue. But Kim was right. She was the only one who understood the algae systems well enough to prevent collapse.

And she was running on fumes.

"I need help," she admitted.

"Park. He's been working with Hassan on the geological surveys. Smart. Detail-oriented. I'll have him reassigned to support you."

Park arrived within an hour. Young. Enthusiastic. Slightly terrified.

"Dr. Tanaka, I don't know anything about algae cultivation."

"You'll learn. Fast." Yuki pulled up the monitoring protocols. "These are the parameters. These are the normal ranges. If anything drifts outside those ranges, you alert me immediately."

She trained him for twelve hours straight. Then forced herself to sleep for six hours while Park watched the tanks.

When she woke, the cultures were stable. Park had handled two minor fluctuations correctly.

"You're a natural," she said.

"I'm terrified of killing everyone."

"Good. Fear keeps you alert." Yuki checked the atmospheric projections. The boosted algae production had bought them time. Oxygen levels were stabilizing.

Not recovering. But not declining either.

"We might actually survive this," she said.

The supply ship arrived thirty-six days after the oxygen crisis began.

The new plants went into the greenhouse immediately. Fast-growing species. High oxygen output. Genetically optimized for Martian conditions.

It took another three weeks for them to establish. To start meaningful production.

But when they did, the atmospheric numbers finally turned positive.

Oxygen climbing. Slowly. But consistently.

Yuki stood in the greenhouse, watching new life spread across the hydroponic beds. Green and alive and producing the air they all needed.

Rivera found her there. "The council wants to commend you. For preventing the crisis."

"I didn't prevent it. I just bought time."

"Sometimes that's all we can do. Buy time. And hope it's enough." Rivera looked at the plants. "Mars keeps trying to kill us."

"And we keep refusing to die." Yuki smiled despite her exhaustion. "Stubborn species, humans."

"Adaptable species. That's why we'll survive." Rivera turned to leave. Then paused. "Yuki? Take a break. That's an order. A real break. Not just sleeping between crisis management."

"Yes, Commander."

Yuki stayed in the greenhouse a while longer. Breathing oxygen produced by plants she'd kept alive through crisis.

The colony would survive. They'd faced water contamination. Subsurface instability. Equipment failures. Atmospheric collapse.

And they'd overcome each one. Not easily. Not without cost.

But they'd survived.

That was the Mars way. Crisis and response. Problem and solution.

Forever adapting. Forever fighting.

Forever refusing to let a dead planet claim them.
