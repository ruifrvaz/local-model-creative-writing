The corporate ship arrived without warning.

Captain Jax Torres watched it drop out of jump space three thousand kilometers from their position. Big. Fast. Military-grade engines on a civilian hull.

Helios Mining. The consortium's enforcement arm.

"Chen, how fast can we jump?" Jax asked.

"Drives are cold. Six hours to charge." The mechanic's voice was tight. "We're sitting ducks."

"Then we talk our way out." Jax activated the comm. "Helios vessel, this is independent mining ship Starling. State your business."

The response came immediately. "Starling, this is Helios Enforcement Vessel Prometheus. We're conducting a safety inspection of all ships operating in this sector. Prepare to be boarded."

"Under what authority?"

"Mining consortium safety regulations. All vessels are subject to inspection." The Helios captain sounded bored. Like this was routine. "Failure to comply will be logged as violation of sector agreements. Stand by for boarding procedures."

Jax looked at Sofia. The xenomineralogist's hands still glowed faintly blue. The exotic matter integrated with her biology made her the most valuable thing in the system. Or the most dangerous.

"Hide," he said quietly.

"Can't. They'll scan for bio-signs. Find me anyway." Sofia pulled on an oversized jacket, trying to cover the glow. "Best case, I look like crew with a weird skin condition. Worst case, they know exactly what they're looking for."

"And if they know?"

"Then we fight. Or die. Or hand me over and hope they don't kill you anyway." Sofia's voice was steady. Professional. Hiding the terror underneath. "Jax, you should space me. Jettison me in an escape pod. Tell them I died in a mining accident. Save the crew."

"Not an option."

"It's the only option that keeps you alive."

Jax pulled up the ship's armament. They had mining lasers. Explosive charges for asteroid breakup. Nothing that would scratch a military-grade hull.

The Helios ship matched velocity. Docking clamps extended.

"All crew to the cargo bay," Jax said over the ship's comm. "Act normal. We're clean. Just miners doing legitimate work. They don't know anything."

The boarding party entered twelve minutes later. Six personnel. Armed with weapons that definitely weren't standard safety inspection gear. Led by a woman whose uniform carried no rank insignia.

"Captain Torres." She didn't offer a handshake. "I'm Director Kain. Helios resource protection division. We need to discuss your recent mining activities in asteroid 2847-Delta."

"Public claim. Properly filed. We followed all regulations." Jax kept his voice level. "What's the problem?"

"No problem. Just questions." Kain pulled out a scanner. "The asteroid's density readings showed unusual characteristics. We wanted to verify your extraction didn't damage the substrate integrity."

She was lying. Jax could see it in her eyes. She knew about the exotic matter. Knew what they'd found.

And she was here to take it.

"Extraction went smoothly. Standard procedures. The asteroid is stable." Jax gestured at their cargo containers. "We pulled iron-nickel ore. Nothing special. Happy to show you the samples."

Kain moved through the ship methodically. Scanning cargo. Checking equipment. Looking for something specific.

She stopped at the sealed container that had held the exotic matter. The one that was now empty because Sofia had absorbed its contents.

"This container shows unusual energy signatures. What was stored here?"

"Sample return vessel. We use it for special mineral analysis." Jax kept his breathing steady. "It's empty now. Samples already processed."

"Processed how?"

"Spectral analysis. Chemical assay. Standard procedures." Jax pulled up fabricated analysis reports. Chen had created them three hours ago, anticipating this exact situation. "Results were unremarkable. You're welcome to review the data."

Kain examined the reports. Her expression didn't change, but Jax saw her hand move toward her sidearm.

"Captain, I'm going to need you to assemble your crew. All personnel. Now."

"On what grounds?"

"Safety inspection includes crew health verification. Standard procedure." Kain's voice was flat. "Assemble your crew or I'll order my team to conduct a forced search."

Jax activated the ship's comm. "All crew to cargo bay. Immediate assembly."

They gathered within minutes. Kayla from the cockpit. Chen from engineering. Sofia from—

Sofia's sleeve had ridden up. The blue glow was visible.

Kain saw it. Her weapon came up immediately. "Nobody move. That crew member is contaminated. Step away from her. Now."

"She's fine," Jax said. "Medical condition. Bioluminescent bacteria. Harmless."

"That's not bacteria." Kain kept her weapon trained on Sofia. "That's exotic matter integration. You found the cache. You exposed yourself to the material. And now you're lying about it."

Sofia raised her hands slowly. "It's not what you think."

"I think you're carrying materials classified under the Xenobiological Threat Protocols. I think you're a walking contamination vector. And I think my orders are to contain that threat by any means necessary." Kain activated her comm. "Prometheus, this is boarding party alpha. Threat confirmed. Requesting immediate containment protocols."

The ship's lights flickered. Jax felt a surge of electricity through the deck plating.

Sofia's eyes were glowing now. Not just her hands. Her whole body was lit from within.

"I'm not a threat," she said quietly. "I'm trying to control this. To understand it. To use it safely."

"You're a hazard. Helios protocol requires immediate neutralization." Kain adjusted her weapon settings. "I'm sorry. But I have my orders."

"Then you'll have to go through me." Jax stepped between them. "She's my crew. Under my protection. You want her, you take us all."

Chen and Kayla moved to flank him. Three people with no weapons facing six armed corporate enforcers.

The math didn't work. But sometimes loyalty mattered more than math.

Kain looked at them. At the crew standing together despite impossible odds. Her expression shifted. Not sympathy. Just calculation.

"You understand what you're protecting? The exotic matter rewrites biology. Spreads through contact. If she reaches a populated station, if the integration accelerates, she could contaminate thousands. Millions." Kain lowered her weapon slightly. "This isn't about profit. It's about preventing a gray goo scenario on a biological scale."

"She's a person," Jax said. "Not a scenario. Not a threat. A person dealing with something we don't understand yet. Give us time to figure it out. To contain it safely."

"I don't have that authority. My orders are clear—neutralize exotic matter contamination on contact. No exceptions." Kain looked at Sofia. "I'm sorry. You seem like good people. But protocols exist for a reason."

The ship's lights flickered again. Harder this time. Electronics sparked. The boarding party's weapons died, power cells drained to zero.

Sofia's glow intensified. "I'm not going to let you kill me. Or my crew. So you have a choice. Leave peacefully. Or find out what this exotic matter can really do when it's threatened."

Kain stared at her. At the raw power radiating from Sofia's cells. At the evidence that whatever the exotic matter was, it had granted abilities beyond anything human technology could match.

"Stand down," she said to her team. "We're leaving."

"Director, our orders—"

"I said stand down. This situation is above our authorization level." Kain backed toward the airlock. "Captain Torres, you have twelve hours to leave this sector. After that, Helios will escalate. They'll send ships with weapons designed to fight exotic matter contamination. And they won't negotiate."

"Understood."

The boarding party withdrew. The Helios ship undocked and burned away from their position.

Jax let out a breath he'd been holding for what felt like hours.

"Sofia, what did you just do?"

"I'm not sure. The exotic matter responded to my fear. My need to protect us. It drained their weapons. Interfaced with their electronics." Sofia looked at her hands. The glow was fading. "I think I can control electrical systems now. Or the exotic matter can. Or we can together. I'm not sure where I end and it begins anymore."

"Can you control the jump drive?" Chen asked.

"Maybe. Why?"

"Because if you can charge it in minutes instead of hours, we can get out of here before Helios comes back with bigger guns." Chen pulled up the drive schematic. "The exotic matter generates free energy. If you can channel that into the drive capacitors—"

"We could jump immediately." Sofia moved to the engineering console. Her hands hovered over the controls. Electricity arced between her fingers and the interface.

The jump drive hummed to life. Charging at rates that should've been impossible.

"Two minutes to jump capability," Chen said, wonder in his voice. "She's doing it."

Jax activated the navigation. "Kayla, set course for the outer system. Somewhere with no corporate presence. We need time to figure out what we're dealing with."

"And then?" Kayla asked.

"Then we decide whether Sofia's a person with a unique condition or a walking apocalypse." Jax looked at his crew. At the woman glowing blue with alien energy. At the choice they'd made to protect her despite the risks. "But we make that choice together. As a crew."

"Jump drive ready," Chen reported. "Captain, we're good to go."

Jax looked at the Helios ship retreating in the distance. At the future rushing toward them at relativistic speeds.

"Punch it," he said.

Reality folded. The ship jumped. And somewhere in the quantum foam between here and there, four miners carrying humanity's future wondered if they'd just saved it or doomed it.

Either way, there was no going back.

Only forward. Into the unknown. Where all the best stories began.
