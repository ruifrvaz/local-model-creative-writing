Engineer Malik Torres stood in the observation deck, watching the distant star that had been his destination for his entire life. Twenty-three years old. Born on this ship. Would die on this ship, if the original mission plan held.

Two hundred years into a four-hundred-year voyage. Halfway to a world he'd never see.

The door hissed open behind him. Dr. Eva Sato entered, carrying her ever-present tablet. The historian was old—sixty-three, ancient by ship standards. She'd been born during the first generation, back when Earth was a memory rather than a myth.

"You're brooding again," Eva said.

"I'm thinking."

"Same thing, for engineers." She joined him at the window. "The council meets in three hours. Are you ready?"

"To argue that we should abandon four centuries of planning? Sure. That'll go well."

Eva smiled slightly. "You're young. You're allowed to question the plan."

"But not allowed to change it, apparently." Malik gestured at the star. "That's Tau Ceti. Eleven point nine light-years from Earth. We're traveling at point-zero-five C. The mathematics are simple. We arrive in two hundred years."

"So why question it?"

"Because we passed Proxima Centauri three years ago. Four point two light-years from Earth. If we'd stopped there, we'd be building a colony right now instead of debating theoretical destinations."

"Proxima Centauri b is marginally habitable at best. High radiation, stellar flares, no magnetic field protection."

"But it exists. We have data on it. We know the risks." Malik pulled up surveys on his own tablet. "Tau Ceti e is pure speculation. Early probe data from four hundred years ago. It might not even be habitable anymore."

"Or it might be perfect."

"Perfect is the enemy of good enough." Malik faced her. "Eva, I've run the genetic diversity models. Our population bottleneck is critical. We need at least three hundred individuals to maintain viability. We have two hundred forty-seven. And that number drops every year."

"Medical Director Okoye says we're stable."

"Medical Director Okoye is optimistic. The genetic data doesn't lie. We're seeing increased recessive disease expression, higher infant mortality, fertility issues. We need fresh genetic material or we need a larger population base."

Eva was quiet. She'd seen the data too. Everyone on the council had.

"And you think Proxima offers that?"

"I think it offers a chance. We could establish a colony, even a difficult one. Start growing the population base. By the time we understand Proxima's full challenges, we'll have more people to face them."

"Or we'll split the population and doom both groups."

Malik acknowledged the risk with a nod. "That's why I'm presenting options, not demands. Turn back to Proxima. Continue to Tau Ceti. Or find a compromise—send a small mission back while the main ship continues forward."

"You want to split us up."

"I want to give people choices. Eva, half this ship was born after departure. We didn't choose this mission. Our parents didn't choose it either. We're living out decisions made by people four generations dead."

"That's how generational missions work. Each generation carries the torch."

"Even when the torch is burning our hands?" Malik pulled up population projections. "If we continue this course, by generation six there's a thirty percent chance of genetic collapse. By generation eight, it's fifty-fifty whether we arrive at Tau Ceti with a viable population."

Eva studied the projections. Her face revealed nothing, but Malik knew she understood the implications.

"Who else supports your proposal?"

"Engineering. Most of agriculture. About forty percent of medical. The younger cohorts are split, but trending toward change."

"And against?"

"Command structure. The old guard. Captain Reyes." Malik hesitated. "Your generation, mostly. The ones who remember the original mission values."

"We remember why we left. What we were running from." Eva's voice was soft. "Earth was dying, Malik. Ecological collapse, resource wars, seven billion people fighting over scraps. The generational ships were humanity's best hope. Seven missions, seven destinations, spreading the species across the stars."

"I know the history."

"Do you? Or do you know the sanitized version we teach children?" Eva sat heavily. "I was twelve when we launched. Old enough to remember Earth. The smog. The rationing. The riots. My father died in the water wars. My mother barely got me onto the ship."

"Eva—"

"The mission to Tau Ceti isn't just about reaching a destination. It's about proving humanity can plan beyond a single generation. That we can work toward goals we'll never personally achieve. That we're not just animals grabbing at immediate survival."

"That's philosophy. I'm talking about genetics."

"Philosophy is what keeps us human when the biology gets difficult." Eva met his eyes. "But you're right. The population models are concerning. Which is why I'm supporting your proposal at the council."

Malik blinked. "You are?"

"With modifications. We don't turn back. The main mission continues to Tau Ceti. But we wake the reserve sleepers."

The reserve sleepers. Two hundred people in cryogenic suspension, insurance against catastrophic population loss. Waking them would double the genetic base, solve the bottleneck problem.

It would also consume resources planned for the final approach to Tau Ceti.

"The power requirements alone—"

"Are manageable if we reduce non-essential systems. We have enough to wake fifty sleepers over the next year. That's fifty new genetic lines, fifty pairs of hands, fifty fresh perspectives."

"Why didn't the council suggest this before?"

"Because waking the sleepers was supposed to be a last resort. An admission that the original plan failed." Eva smiled sadly. "Pride, basically. We wanted to prove we could complete the mission without help from frozen ancestors."

"That's insane."

"That's human. But I've reviewed your data, Malik. The genetic bottleneck is real. We need new blood, literally. I'll argue for waking the sleepers."

The council meeting was tense. Captain Ana Reyes presided, her expression skeptical as Malik presented his population models.

"You're suggesting we admit failure," Reyes said when he finished.

"I'm suggesting we adapt to current conditions instead of dying slowly for the sake of a plan that didn't account for genetic drift."

Medical Director James Okoye pulled up his own data. "Malik's models are accurate. We are seeing genetic stress. But I want to emphasize that we're not at crisis point yet. We have time."

"How much time?" Eva asked.

"Conservatively? Fifty years before we see major population impacts."

"Fifty years is two generations," Malik said. "By then, the damage might be irreversible."

"Or we might reach Tau Ceti to find conditions that make population growth easy," Reyes countered. "We have two hundred years remaining. Plenty of time to course-correct if needed."

"You're gambling with human lives."

"We've been gambling with human lives since we left Earth. That's what exploration means."

Malik felt frustration building. "This isn't exploration. It's blind faith in a plan that might be obsolete."

"Watch your tone, Engineer."

"Captain, he's right." Eva's calm voice cut through the tension. "The plan is four hundred years old. Written for conditions that no longer exist. We've learned things about genetics, about closed-system ecology, about human psychology under isolation. Sticking to the original mission parameters isn't loyalty. It's stubbornness."

Reyes looked at the historian. "You're supporting this?"

"I'm supporting adaptation. Specifically, waking the reserve sleepers. Fifty individuals over the next year. Enough to stabilize our genetic base while maintaining the core mission to Tau Ceti."

The council erupted in arguments. Malik watched the debate flow around him, seeing the divisions clearly. The old guard wanted to maintain the mission. The younger generation wanted practical solutions. The middle cohort was split, torn between inherited purpose and present reality.

Finally, Reyes called for quiet.

"We'll vote. All in favor of waking the reserve sleepers?"

Hands rose. Malik's. Eva's. Three others.

"Opposed?"

Four hands.

"The motion fails. We continue current course without modification."

Malik felt the decision like a physical blow. "Captain—"

"The council has spoken, Engineer Torres. Dismissed."

Outside the council chamber, Eva touched his shoulder. "Don't give up."

"They won't listen."

"Not yet. But you planted seeds. People are thinking about it now. That's how change happens—slowly, then all at once."

Malik walked through the ship's corridors, seeing it differently now. Not a vessel carrying humanity to the stars. A prison. A slow-motion death sentence for people who'd never chosen this fate.

He passed the nursery, where the newest generation played under careful supervision. Twelve children born this year. Each one carrying recessive markers, genetic load accumulating with every generation.

In the genetics lab, he pulled up his own profile. Heterozygous for six different recessive disorders. Not unusual. Everyone on the ship carried similar loads.

But when he looked at potential partners—the limited pool of genetically compatible individuals—the math got uglier. Any children he had would have a twenty-five percent chance of expressing at least one serious genetic disorder.

Those odds got worse every generation.

His comm chimed. Private message from Medical Director Okoye.

"Malik, can we talk? My office, when you have time."

Malik found the director reviewing genetic data, his expression troubled.

"Thank you for coming. I wanted to apologize for my position at the council. You were right. The genetic stress is worse than I acknowledged publicly."

"Why didn't you support the proposal?"

"Politics. Captain Reyes has strong feelings about the mission purity. If I'd sided with you, she'd have removed me from the medical directorship." Okoye pulled up projections. "But privately, I'm concerned. Very concerned. We need genetic intervention within twenty years, or we start seeing serious population impacts."

"Then why lie to the council?"

"I didn't lie. I was... optimistic about our timeline. But Malik, I can't fight the captain directly. She has too much support among the first and second generation colonists."

"So what do we do?"

"We prepare. Quietly. I'll start documenting genetic issues more thoroughly. Building an undeniable case. You keep pushing for change, making people uncomfortable with the status quo. Eventually, the data will force action."

"And in the meantime, people suffer."

"Yes." Okoye met his eyes. "That's the cost of changing minds. Patience and accumulated evidence. Not as satisfying as immediate revolution, but more likely to succeed."

Malik returned to his quarters feeling defeated but not destroyed. Eva was right. Change happened slowly.

He could be patient. He could document. He could build the case.

And when the council finally accepted reality, he'd have the solutions ready.

Outside his window, the stars streamed past at five percent of light speed. Tau Ceti gleamed ahead, promise or delusion depending on your perspective.

Malik chose to see it as neither. Just a destination. One option among many.

And if he could convince enough people that other options existed, maybe they'd choose survival over mythology.

Maybe they'd choose the future over the past.

Maybe they'd choose to live instead of dying for someone else's dream.

He opened his tablet and began drafting a new proposal. Not for the council. For the people. The engineers, the teachers, the hydroponics workers. The ones who kept the ship running while the command structure debated philosophy.

The ones who'd inherit the consequences of today's decisions.

His people. His generation.

The future, whether the captain liked it or not.
