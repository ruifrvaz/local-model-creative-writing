The engineering bay hummed with activity. Malik stood at the main control panel, initiating deceleration calculations. After two hundred thirty-three years of constant acceleration, the ship would begin slowing.

Destination: HD 85512. Ninety-two years from current position.

"Deceleration burn sequence loaded," Rodriguez reported. "Main engines ready for thrust reversal."

"Life support compensations?"

"Implemented. Rotational artificial gravity will maintain stability during deceleration. Crew should experience minimal disruption."

Malik activated the shipwide comm. "All crew, this is Chief Engineer Torres. Deceleration burn begins in ten minutes. Secure all loose items, verify harness attachment in designated areas. This is not a drill."

He looked around the engineering bay. His team—some third-generation like him, most fourth-generation—worked efficiently. They'd trained for this maneuver their entire careers. Now it was real.

Sofia joined him at the control panel. "Keiko wants to watch from the observation deck."

"Did you explain what happens? The visual effect?"

"I told her the stars will stop streaking. They'll become points again as we slow down. She's excited."

Malik felt a mix of emotions. Pride that his daughter understood the physics. Sadness that this moment marked abandoning the original mission. Relief that they'd chosen a reachable destination.

"How are you feeling about this?" Sofia asked quietly.

"Like we're betraying everyone who died believing we'd reach Tau Ceti."

"Or like we're honoring them by choosing survival over symbolism."

"Depends on the day."

The countdown reached five minutes. Malik pulled up the burn calculations one final time. Deceleration would be gradual—years of reduced thrust, carefully managed to prevent structural damage. The ship wasn't designed for rapid course changes. Everything happened slowly at interstellar scales.

"Captain Reyes to engineering," the comm crackled. "Status?"

"Ready for deceleration burn. All systems green. Crew secured."

"Proceed on schedule. And Malik?"

"Yes, Captain?"

"Thank you. For making this work despite personal reservations."

"That's the job."

The countdown hit zero. Malik activated the deceleration sequence.

Deep in the ship's core, the main engines reversed thrust. Carefully, incrementally, applying force opposite to their current trajectory. The effect wouldn't be immediately visible—their velocity was too high, the deceleration too gradual.

But it was happening. After two centuries of acceleration toward Tau Ceti, they were slowing. Preparing to redirect toward HD 85512.

"Burn stable," Rodriguez reported. "Engines performing within expected parameters. Structural stress nominal."

Malik monitored the readings. Temperature, thrust output, fuel consumption, structural integrity. Everything perfect. The ship was built well. The original engineers had done extraordinary work.

"Estimated time to complete velocity change?" Captain Reyes asked over the comm.

"Seven years at current burn rate. Then we redirect and begin acceleration toward HD 85512. Total course change duration: fourteen years."

"Fourteen years just to change course. We're committed now."

"We were committed when the vote passed. This is just physics catching up to democracy."

The engineering bay settled into routine monitoring. Deceleration burn would continue for years. Constant vigilance, endless adjustment, perpetual maintenance.

Same as everything else on the ship. Just pointed a different direction.

Malik found Keiko at the observation deck as promised. She pressed her face against the viewport, watching the stars.

"They're not changing yet," she said, disappointed.

"They will. Slowly. Over weeks and months. You'll notice one day that they're not streaking as much. Eventually they'll be points again, like they were when we launched."

"You weren't there when we launched."

"No. But I've seen the recordings. Earth looking like a blue marble. The ship accelerating. The stars stretching into lines as relativity kicked in."

"Do you miss Earth?"

"Can't miss something I never knew. But sometimes I wonder what it would have been like. Real sky. Natural ecosystems. Weather."

"HD 85512 has weather."

"Harsh weather. Extreme temperatures. Thin atmosphere. It's not Earth."

Keiko was quiet for a moment. Then: "Are you glad we're going there instead of Tau Ceti?"

Malik considered. He'd voted for diversion twice. Won the second time by 193 votes. Should feel vindicated. Instead just felt tired.

"I'm glad we're going somewhere we might actually reach. Whether that's worth abandoning the original mission, I don't know."

"Mom says the journey is what matters. That changing destination doesn't invalidate the journey."

"Your mom is wiser than me."

"She says you're more honest than wise sometimes. That you tell the truth even when it's uncomfortable."

"Wisdom is knowing when to be honest and when to be kind. I haven't mastered that balance."

They watched the stars together. Father and daughter, third and fourth generation, inheriting and bequeathing impossible burdens.

"I'm scared," Keiko admitted. "HD 85512 isn't like the ship. We'll have to build everything from nothing. What if we can't survive there?"

"Then we die trying. Same as we'd die trying to reach Tau Ceti. The risks are different, not eliminated."

"That's not comforting."

"No. But it's honest."

Malik pulled up the HD 85512 data on his tablet. Marginal world in the habitable zone of an orange dwarf star. Atmosphere seventy percent Earth-normal pressure. Surface temperature averaging fifteen Celsius at the equator, minus forty at the poles. Gravity point-eight-six Earth standard. Water present but mostly subsurface ice.

Challenging. Not impossible.

"You'll be forty-one when we arrive," Malik said. "Old enough to be part of the settlement leadership. Your generation will build the colony."

"If we survive the landing."

"We'll survive. We've maintained a ship for two hundred thirty years through system failures and resource crises. We can establish a planetary colony."

"You sound certain."

"I'm faking it. For your benefit."

Keiko smiled. "Thanks for the honesty."

The observation deck door opened. Dr. Okoye entered, looking for Malik.

"We need to discuss the medical protocols for deceleration. Long-term low-thrust burn has physiological effects."

Malik nodded. "I'll be there shortly."

After Okoye left, Malik squeezed Keiko's shoulder. "I have to work. Will you be okay here?"

"Yeah. I want to watch the stars a while longer. See if I can notice any change."

"You won't. Not today. But keep watching. Eventually you'll see it."

Malik returned to engineering. The deceleration burn continued steadily. Numbers on screens tracking infinitesimal changes in velocity. The ship slowing from eighteen percent light speed by tiny fractions every second.

In seven years, they'd be moving slow enough to redirect. In fourteen, they'd be accelerating toward HD 85512. In ninety-two, they'd arrive.

Most crew members currently alive would survive to see it. That was new. Novel. For two hundred years, no one had expected to reach the destination in their lifetime. Now they might.

Changed the psychological calculus entirely. Made the mission tangible instead of abstract. A goal that could be personally achieved instead of just passed forward.

Maybe that would help. Maybe fourth-generation crew would find meaning in achievable objectives that third-generation had lacked.

Or maybe they'd find new things to resent. New ways to question inherited choices.

Time would tell.

Malik pulled up the long-range sensor data. HD 85512 was getting better resolution as they approached. The planet looked harsh. Reddish surface, thin cloud coverage, ice caps covering forty percent of surface area.

But it was a world. Solid ground. Real gravity. Actual sky.

After two hundred thirty years in a metal tube, even a harsh world seemed like paradise.

"Torres to Captain Reyes. Deceleration burn nominal. All systems stable. Estimate seven years to velocity null."

"Copy that, Engineering. The crew is handling the transition well. No major incidents reported."

"Good to hear. Torres out."

Malik settled into his station. Seven years of deceleration. Fourteen years of course change. Ninety-two years to destination.

One hundred thirteen years total. He'd be one hundred forty-six years old at arrival. Unlikely to survive that long. Maybe see the approach, the final deceleration, the orbital insertion. Probably not the landing.

But Keiko would see it. Would be part of the settlement. Would build something new on harsh ground under alien sky.

That was legacy. Passing forward the mission in evolved form. Trusting the next generation to complete what you started.

The ship hummed around him. Decelerating slowly, reversing two centuries of acceleration, preparing to redirect toward a different destination.

The mission wasn't over. Just changed. Adapted. Evolved.

Same crew. Same ship. Same purpose. Different coordinates.

Malik could live with that. Could dedicate the remainder of his life to making it work.

Because what else was there? The choice was made. The burn was initiated. Physics didn't care about regrets.

Forward momentum. Always forward. Even when forward meant slowing down to turn around.

That was generational missions. That was deep space travel. That was the human condition writ large against the void.

Choose a direction. Commit fully. Adapt when necessary. Persist regardless.

Malik would persist. Would maintain systems. Would transfer knowledge. Would raise his daughter to continue the work.

One burn at a time. One course correction at a time. One generation at a time.

Until they reached HD 85512. Or discovered some new impossibility to overcome.

Either way, they'd face it together. As a crew. As a family. As humans who refused to give up despite overwhelming odds.

That had to count for something.

Malik believed it did. Chose to believe it did. Made that belief his purpose when certainty was unavailable.

Faith, in the end. Not religious faith. Engineering faith. The belief that systems maintained with care would function as designed. That people working together could achieve more than individuals alone. That persistence mattered even when outcomes were uncertain.

Malik had that faith. Would carry it forward. Would pass it to Keiko and her generation.

And they'd use it to build something new. On HD 85512. Under orange dwarf light. In harsh conditions that would test everything they were.

They'd survive. Or die trying. Either way, they'd prove humans could adapt. Could persist. Could find meaning in impossible circumstances.

That was the real mission. Always had been. Destination was just coordinates. The journey was the achievement.

Malik finally understood what Eva had been trying to teach them. What Chen Li-hua had known instinctively. What the mission planners had hoped for but couldn't guarantee.

Humanity's capacity to maintain purpose across generations. To adapt without losing identity. To survive without becoming mere survival machines.

They were doing it. Proving it. One impossible day at a time.

The deceleration burn continued. The stars slowly, imperceptibly, began their journey back toward points of light.

And Malik Torres, third-generation chief engineer, maintained the systems that made it all possible.

One burn. One day. One generation.

Until they arrived.

Or evolved into something that transcended arrival entirely.

Either way, forward.

Always forward.
