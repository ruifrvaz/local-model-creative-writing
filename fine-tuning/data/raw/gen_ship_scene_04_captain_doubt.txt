Captain Ana Reyes stood in the observation dome and watched three thousand lives drift through the void.

The generation ship Perseverance was everything she'd known. Born here. Raised here. Trained to command here. Her great-grandmother had been captain. Her grandmother. Her mother.

Four generations of Reyes women guiding humanity toward a destination they'd never see.

Ana pulled up the mission log. Day seventy-three thousand, four hundred and twelve. Two hundred and one years since Earth orbit departure. One hundred ninety-nine years until projected arrival at Kepler-442b.

Halfway point. The moment when continuing forward and turning back required equal effort.

Except they'd found the planet. The unexpected world that offered early escape from the mission.

And the genetics were failing.

And the vote was split.

Ana Reyes, third-generation captain, had to decide whether to honor her ancestors or save her people.

"Captain." Malik Torres appeared in the observation dome. Young. Brilliant. Certain that the mission mattered more than individuals.

"Malik."

"The scout ship is prepping for launch. James wanted you to know."

Ana nodded. The scout mission was the compromise. Six people investigating the planet while Perseverance continued its slow voyage.

Buying time. Delaying the real decision.

"How's the crew morale?" she asked.

"Split. Same as the council. Half want to turn back. Half want to continue. Everyone's scared we're choosing wrong."

"We probably are. Question is which wrong choice we can live with."

Malik moved to the viewport. Outside, the stars wheeled slowly. The ship's rotation provided gravity. The spin that kept bones strong and blood circulating properly.

"My grandfather died believing in this mission," Malik said. "Spent forty years maintaining systems. Never questioned whether it was worth it."

"Was it?"

"I don't know. He thought so. That's enough, isn't it?"

Ana thought about her own mother. Captain of Perseverance for thirty-eight years before radiation exposure forced early retirement. She'd spent her last days in medical, still reviewing ship's logs. Still planning for contingencies she'd never see.

"My mother told me the hardest part of being captain was accepting you won't see the end," Ana said. "That your job is carrying people toward a future you'll never experience."

"And now we might abandon that future."

"Or we might save the people who are supposed to reach it."

They watched the stars in silence. Ana thought about the weight of command. The responsibility of deciding for three thousand people. The knowledge that whatever choice she made, half the ship would think it was wrong.

"What would you do?" she asked Malik. "If it was just you. No ship. No mission. No obligations."

Malik thought about it. "I'd want to see Kepler-442b. Know if it's everything we hoped. Everything we sacrificed for."

"Even if you died before arrival?"

"Especially then. Because dying on the journey means the journey mattered. Turning back means it was all waste."

"Or it means we were smart enough to adapt."

"Is that what you think? That we should turn back?"

Ana pulled up the ship's systems status. Life support at ninety-four percent efficiency. Fusion reactor operating within parameters. Hull integrity holding despite two centuries of micrometeorite impacts.

The ship could complete the voyage. Probably.

The people might not.

"I think we're asking the wrong question," Ana said. "It's not about the mission versus the people. It's about which version of humanity we want to preserve."

"Elaborate."

"The mission preserves determination. Commitment to goals. The idea that some things are worth dying for." Ana pulled up the cultural archives. "The planet preserves survival. Adaptation. The willingness to change plans when reality demands it."

"You're saying both choices are valid."

"I'm saying both choices cost something. And I don't know which cost is worth paying."

Malik was quiet for a long moment. "The scout ship might make the decision easier."

"Or harder. If James confirms the planet is viable, the pressure to turn back increases. If it's not viable, we've wasted resources and time."

"Better than making the decision blind."

"Maybe."

The observation dome's comm chimed. James Okoye's voice: "Captain Reyes. Scout ship is launching. See you in three years."

Ana activated her response. "Good luck, James. Bring us answers."

"I'll bring you data. Answers are above my pay grade."

The comm went silent. Ana watched through the viewport as the scout ship detached. Small. Fast. Capable of the jump that Perseverance's mass made impossible.

Six people heading toward a planet that might save them all. Or prove that the original plan was the only option.

"I envy them," Malik said.

"Why?"

"They get to know. We're stuck here, waiting. Guessing."

"They're also risking everything on a three-year mission to an unknown world. I don't envy that."

Malik pulled up the ship's trajectory. "We're passing the point of no return soon. Another month at current velocity, and we won't have enough fuel to decelerate and turn back."

Ana knew. She'd been watching the deadline approach like an asteroid on collision course.

"So in one month, the decision makes itself."

"Unless you order course change before then."

"Based on what? Hope that James finds something? Fear that the genetics will fail?"

"Based on your judgment as captain."

Ana felt the weight of three thousand lives pressing down. The expectations of generations who'd died believing in the mission. The needs of generations not yet born who'd inherit whatever choice she made.

"I'm not sure my judgment is enough," she said quietly.

"It has to be. You're captain."

"I'm one person. Making decisions that affect everyone."

"That's what command is."

Ana looked at Malik. Saw certainty in his eyes. The kind of certainty that came from never doubting the mission.

She envied that. And feared it.

"Get some rest," she told him. "Tomorrow we're implementing the resource conservation measures. Everyone's going to be working harder."

After Malik left, Ana stayed in the observation dome. Watching stars. Watching the void.

Somewhere ahead, Kepler-442b waited. The world Earth's best minds had chosen. The destination that justified two hundred years of sacrifice.

Somewhere behind, a planet they'd discovered. Unexpected. Unknown. Possibly salvation.

Ana Reyes had one month to decide which future humanity deserved.

She pulled up her mother's final log entry.

"To whoever follows me as captain: Trust yourself. Trust the ship. Trust that the people who sent us knew what they were doing. The mission matters. Never forget that."

Ana closed the log and wondered if her mother had ever doubted. Ever questioned whether the mission was worth the cost.

Probably. But she'd never admitted it in the logs.

Captains didn't doubt. Not officially.

Ana started her own log entry.

"Captain's log. Day seventy-three thousand, four hundred and twelve. Scout mission launched. Point of no return approaches. Decision pending.

I don't know if I'm strong enough for this.

But I'm captain. So I'll decide.

And pray I'm choosing the future we deserve, not the one we fear."

She saved the log and left the observation dome.

Three thousand people slept in their quarters. Trusting that their captain knew what she was doing.

Ana hoped they were right.

Because she wasn't sure anymore.
