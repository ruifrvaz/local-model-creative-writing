Chen Wu stood outside conference room six, reviewing his notes on a tablet that showed nothing useful. The Coalition delegation would arrive in three minutes. He'd have forty-five minutes to determine what they actually wanted versus what they'd say they wanted.

The difference would determine whether people lived or died.

Lena materialized beside him like a shadow given form. "Security sweep is complete. Room's clean."

"You sound disappointed."

"I'd prefer finding bugs to wondering where they are." She pulled up her scanner. "Coalition's moving. Director Kim and three advisors. Security staying in quarters."

"Smart. Less intimidation, more cooperation."

"Or they're confident enough not to need muscle in the room." Lena's expression was neutral. "Your call whether that's reassuring or terrifying."

The door opened. Kim entered with the precise movements of someone who'd calculated optimal positioning before arrival. Two advisors flanked her—David Park, looking pale but functional, and a woman Chen recognized as Dr. Yuki Tanaka, Coalition's lead science advisor.

"Ambassador Chen." Kim took the offered seat. "Thank you for accommodating our early arrival."

"Punctuality is its own form of communication." Chen gestured to Lena. "Security Chief Volkov will be present for all preliminary meetings. Standard protocol."

Kim's expression flickered. "I was under the impression these would be private discussions."

"They're private from external parties. Station security remains present to ensure facility integrity." Chen kept his voice even. "Non-negotiable."

A three-second pause while Kim calculated whether to object further. Then a slight nod. "Understood."

Chen pulled up a neutral agenda on the central display. "Let's start with basics. What does Earth Coalition hope to achieve from these negotiations?"

"Prevention of unnecessary conflict." Kim's answer was smooth, practiced. "The outer colonies are operating with dangerous autonomy. Trade disruptions, military buildups, territorial claims that violate established agreements. We need framework for resolving disputes without violence."

"The colonies would argue that Earth's resource extraction violates their sovereignty."

"Colonies that exist because of Earth investment, using technology developed with Earth funding, sustained by supply chains Earth maintains." Dr. Tanaka leaned forward. "They don't get to declare independence while keeping all the infrastructure we built."

"And yet they're human beings with the same rights to self-determination that Earth claimed centuries ago." Chen watched reactions carefully. "Circular arguments won't solve anything. What specific concessions is Coalition willing to make?"

Kim exchanged glances with her advisors. "We're prepared to discuss increased colonial representation in trade negotiations. Limited local governance on non-strategic resources. Expanded communication protocols to reduce misunderstandings."

"What about military presence?"

"Earth Coalition maintains defensive forces to protect shipping lanes and commercial interests. That's not negotiable."

"The colonies see those forces as occupation troops."

"The colonies see threats where we position assets for mutual protection." Kim's voice hardened slightly. "We've lost seventeen vessels to pirate attacks in the last year. Someone has to maintain order."

Chen made notes. The Coalition position was exactly what he'd expected—minor concessions on governance, no movement on security issues, framework that preserved Earth's strategic control while offering symbolic autonomy.

It wouldn't satisfy Mars or the outer stations. Not even close.

"Let's talk about what Coalition knows about current colonial positions," he said.

"We know they're preparing for conflict." Park spoke for the first time. "Military exercises, weapons development, coordination between previously independent stations. They're building an alliance against Earth."

"Or they're responding to perceived threat of Coalition fleet movements."

"Perception doesn't matter when ships are real." Park's intensity suggested personal stakes. "We've detected weapons platforms being constructed in the outer belt. Kinetic kill systems capable of destroying supply transports. That's not defensive posture."

"How did Coalition obtain that intelligence?" Lena asked quietly.

The room temperature seemed to drop five degrees. Park looked at Kim, who kept her expression carefully blank.

"We have sources," Kim said. "Standard diplomatic intelligence gathering."

"Spies." Chen kept his tone neutral. "Which the colonies also certainly have within Coalition space."

"Mutual surveillance is reality of interplanetary politics."

"Acknowledged. I'm not criticizing methodology. I'm establishing that both sides have incomplete and possibly misleading information." Chen switched the display to a timeline. "Three months ago, Coalition fleet conducted exercises near Mars orbit. Two months ago, colonial stations began construction projects that might be military facilities. Six weeks ago, a Coalition supply ship was destroyed by unknown attackers. Four weeks ago, Mars Defense Force went to elevated readiness."

"Your point?" Kim asked.

"My point is that neither side knows who started the escalation, and both sides believe they're responding defensively to the other's aggression." Chen met her eyes. "That's the cycle that leads to war. Someone has to break it."

"And you think Coalition should unilaterally stand down while colonies continue militarizing?"

"I think both sides need to realize that destroying each other destroys humanity's future in space." Chen pulled up casualty projections. "Fleet analysis suggests open conflict would kill fifty thousand people in the first week. A hundred thousand in the first month. And that's before we account for infrastructure destruction, supply chain collapse, and orbital debris making space travel impossible."

The room was quiet. Dr. Tanaka looked at the numbers with the expression of someone confronting unwanted data.

"Those projections assume worst-case scenarios," Kim said.

"Which are becoming more likely every day you wait to negotiate seriously." Chen closed the display. "So I'll ask again: what is Coalition willing to give up to prevent that outcome?"

Kim was silent for a long moment. Then: "We need guarantees. Not promises—actual enforceable mechanisms. If we reduce military presence, how do we prevent colonial aggression? If we grant autonomy, how do we ensure continued cooperation on shared resources?"

"Those are legitimate questions. Mars will have similar concerns about Earth's intentions." Chen made more notes. "Building trust verification systems will be central to any agreement."

"Trust." Park's laugh was bitter. "You want us to trust people who are building weapons designed to kill Earth citizens?"

"I want you to trust that continued escalation kills everyone. Whether you trust individuals is secondary to trusting the process." Chen stood. "We'll reconvene tomorrow after I've met with Mars delegation. I want both sides to prepare proposals for mutual verification—what you're willing to allow monitoring of, what you need to see from the other side. Specific mechanisms, not general principles."

Kim rose, her advisors following. "Ambassador, off the record—do you think this can work?"

Chen considered. "I think the alternative is unacceptable. That usually focuses minds."

"Unless someone wants the alternative." Kim glanced at Lena. "Your security chief mentioned potential sabotage threats. We've received similar intelligence. Someone may be trying to ensure these negotiations fail."

"Which is why we all need to work together to identify and prevent that outcome." Chen moved toward the door. "Trust starts with shared information. If you have specifics about the threat, give them to Chief Volkov."

After the Coalition delegation left, Lena pulled up her security logs.

"They're lying about something," she said.

"Everyone's lying about something. Question is whether the lies are tactical or existential." Chen reviewed his notes. "What did you read?"

"Park's panic earlier wasn't random. He knows something specific, and it terrifies him." Lena highlighted surveillance footage. "Dr. Tanaka kept checking her tablet during the meeting. Either she was bored or she was monitoring something."

"And Kim?"

"Kim is exactly what she appears to be—a professional diplomat doing an impossible job with inadequate tools." Lena switched feeds. "Which might make her the most dangerous person in the room. True believers are unpredictable."

Chen pulled up the Mars delegation schedule. Ninety minutes until his next meeting. Time to review what Coalition had revealed and prepare for what Mars would hide.

The game was accelerating. Pieces moving into position.

He just couldn't see the whole board yet.
