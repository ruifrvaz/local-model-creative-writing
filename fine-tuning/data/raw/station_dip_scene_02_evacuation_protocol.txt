Security Officer Lena Volkov reviewed the evacuation drill results with mounting frustration. Twenty-three minutes to move ten thousand people to safe zones. Protocol required it be done in fifteen.

"We're too slow," she told her team. "If we had a real emergency—pressure breach, fire, toxic release—people would die before we got them to safety."

"The corridors are too narrow," her deputy offered. "We can't move that many people quickly through current infrastructure."

"Then we need to redesign the evacuation routes. Or run more drills until people move faster." Lena pulled up station schematics, looking for bottlenecks.

Director Nkrumah entered the security center. "I heard about the drill results. Problems?"

"We're eight minutes too slow. That's unacceptable."

"Agreed. But Lena, we can't just drill more frequently. People have jobs, responsibilities. We need smarter solutions, not more repetition."

"I'm open to suggestions."

"What if we decentralized? Instead of evacuating everyone to central safe zones, we create distributed safe rooms throughout the station. Shorter travel distances, less congestion."

Lena considered it. "That would require significant construction. Reinforced rooms, independent life support, emergency supplies."

"But it would save lives. And it fits with our diplomatic mission—showing that we prioritize safety for all residents and visitors."

"I'll draft a proposal. Costs, timeline, resource requirements. Should have it ready in forty-eight hours."

"Make it twenty-four. We have a high-profile negotiation starting in three days. I want to show the delegates that we take security seriously."

After Nkrumah left, Lena dove into the planning. Distributed safe rooms. She'd need engineering support, resource allocation, political buy-in from the residents whose space would be repurposed.

Ambassador Chen appeared in her office at 1900 hours.

"Director Nkrumah said you're planning a safety infrastructure overhaul. I'd like to be involved."

"This is security planning, Ambassador. Not really your domain."

"It's very much my domain. Diplomacy requires trust. Trust requires safety. If delegates don't feel secure, negotiations fail." Chen pulled up recent diplomatic incidents. "I can show you three major treaties that collapsed because of security concerns. Real or perceived, doesn't matter. Fear kills diplomacy."

Lena studied him. The Ambassador was right. Security wasn't just about preventing harm—it was about creating the perception of safety.

"What do you suggest?"

"Transparent security. Show the delegates our planning, our protocols, our response capabilities. Let them see that we've thought through every scenario. That builds confidence."

"Transparency can also reveal vulnerabilities."

"Only if you have vulnerabilities to hide. Do we?"

Lena thought about the sabotage incident, the narrow evacuation drill results, the aging infrastructure showing stress cracks.

"We have challenges. But we're addressing them."

"Then show that. Involve the delegates in safety briefings. Let them tour our security systems. Demonstrate competence through transparency."

"That's... actually not a bad idea."

"I'm full of them." Chen smiled. "When do you need the proposal done?"

"Twenty-four hours."

"Then let's work together. You bring security expertise. I'll bring diplomatic framing. We'll create a proposal that addresses both safety and trust."

They worked through the night. Distributed safe rooms. Enhanced evacuation protocols. Transparent security briefings. Community involvement in safety planning.

By dawn, they had a comprehensive proposal. One that would cost significant resources but potentially transform the station's safety infrastructure and diplomatic reputation.

Nkrumah approved it with minimal modifications.

"Implement immediately. I want at least ten safe rooms operational before the negotiations begin. The rest can be phased in over six months."

"That's an aggressive timeline," Lena warned.

"We're a diplomatic station hosting tense negotiations between factions that have fought wars against each other. Aggressive timelines are necessary."

Construction began that afternoon. Engineering teams repurposed storage rooms, crew quarters, recreational spaces. Each location received reinforced walls, independent life support, emergency supplies, and communication systems.

The station's residents watched the work with mixed reactions. Some appreciated the safety improvements. Others resented the disruption.

Lena addressed concerns at a public meeting.

"I understand this is inconvenient. We're taking space, making noise, disrupting routines. But these safe rooms could save your lives. In a crisis, you'll need somewhere to shelter. Somewhere secure. These rooms provide that."

"Why now?" someone asked. "We've operated for twenty years without distributed safe rooms."

"Because we're identifying risks and addressing them before they become catastrophes. That's what responsible security looks like."

"Or you know something we don't. Is there a specific threat?"

Lena chose her words carefully. "There's always threat potential on a diplomatic station. We host negotiations between parties with conflicting interests. We maintain neutrality in a polarized political environment. We're a target by definition. These improvements acknowledge that reality."

The answer satisfied some, worried others. But construction continued.

Three days later, the first phase was complete. Ten safe rooms, strategically distributed throughout the station. Each one tested, certified, ready for emergency use.

The Earth Coalition and Martian Independence Front delegates arrived that evening. Ambassador Chen personally conducted their security briefing.

"We've recently enhanced our emergency protocols," he explained, showing them the safe room network. "In any crisis scenario, you'll have multiple shelter options within sixty seconds of your current location."

"This is impressive," Ambassador Torres from Earth said. "Most diplomatic stations don't invest this heavily in safety infrastructure."

"We're not most diplomatic stations. We're neutral ground where historic agreements are forged. That requires special care." Chen pulled up evacuation simulations. "We run regular drills, maintain transparent communication about threats, and empower residents to participate in their own safety."

Commissioner Zhao from Mars nodded approvingly. "You're setting a new standard for diplomatic security. I appreciate that."

The briefing achieved its purpose. Both delegations felt confident in the station's safety measures. The negotiations began in an atmosphere of trust.

Then, on day four, the station's structural sensors detected something wrong.

Micro-fractures in the main habitat ring. Small, growing, potentially catastrophic.

Lena received the alert at 0300 and immediately convened emergency staff.

"How bad?" Nkrumah asked.

"Unknown. Engineering is assessing now. But Director, if the ring fails, we're looking at catastrophic decompression across six sectors."

"Evacuation time to safe rooms?"

"Two minutes if we start now. Fifteen if we wait for engineering assessment."

"Start evacuation. Better cautious than dead."

Lena activated station-wide alerts. "This is Security Officer Volkov. We are implementing emergency evacuation protocol. All personnel proceed to your designated safe rooms immediately. This is not a drill."

Ten thousand people moved with practiced efficiency. Corridors filled, but the distributed safe room system prevented congestion. Within four minutes, ninety-eight percent of the station was secured.

The Earth and Mars delegates watched from their safe room, communicating with Nkrumah via secured channel.

"Director, what's happening?" Torres asked.

"Structural concerns in the habitat ring. We're being cautious while engineering assesses the situation."

"How serious?"

"Unknown. We'll have answers shortly."

Engineering worked fast. Dr. Sarah Okonkwo, leading the assessment, reported back within twenty minutes.

"The fractures are real but stable. Caused by cumulative thermal cycling stress. Not immediately dangerous, but they'll propagate if unaddressed. We need to depressurize the affected sectors and conduct repairs."

"Time required?" Nkrumah asked.

"Seventy-two hours minimum. Possibly longer depending on what we find when we get inside the walls."

"And until then?"

"Safe rooms stay active. We maintain evacuation status until repairs are complete."

Nkrumah made the announcement. "All personnel, this is Director Nkrumah. We have identified structural issues requiring immediate repair. You will remain in safe rooms for the next seventy-two hours while engineering addresses the problem. I know this is inconvenient. I appreciate your patience and cooperation."

Three days in cramped safe rooms. Ten thousand people, including high-profile diplomats, living in emergency conditions.

It was a test of everything they'd built. The infrastructure. The planning. The trust.

Lena monitored the situation from the security center, which had its own safe room protocols.

"How are people handling it?" Nkrumah asked.

"Better than expected. Complaints, but no panic. The safe rooms are functioning as designed. Life support stable, supplies adequate, communication maintained."

"And the delegates?"

Ambassador Chen reported from the diplomatic safe room. "They're actually using the time productively. Conducting informal negotiations in close quarters. Sometimes proximity forces honesty."

Lena smiled. "Leave it to diplomats to turn a crisis into an opportunity."

"It's what we do."

Engineering completed repairs in sixty-eight hours. Four hours ahead of schedule. The structural reinforcement added redundancy that would prevent similar issues for decades.

When the all-clear was given, people emerged from safe rooms tired, frustrated, but alive. And impressed.

The system had worked. The distributed safe rooms had protected everyone. The transparent communication had prevented panic. The preparation had paid off.

Ambassador Torres approached Lena after the evacuation ended.

"Officer Volkov, I was skeptical when you conducted that security briefing. Thought it was just diplomatic theater. I was wrong. You saved lives with that infrastructure. Possibly mine."

"Just doing my job, Ambassador."

"It's more than a job. It's a commitment to safety that I've rarely seen." Torres extended his hand. "Thank you. For taking security seriously. For planning ahead. For caring about the people you protect."

Lena shook his hand. "That's what responsible security looks like."

The negotiations concluded successfully two weeks later. Both sides credited the station's professional handling of the structural crisis as evidence that neutral ground could work.

Trust had been built. Through competence, transparency, and genuine care for everyone's safety.

Lena filed her after-action report with quiet satisfaction. They'd faced a real crisis and emerged stronger.

The distributed safe rooms became permanent. Other stations began requesting design specifications. The model was spreading.

And somewhere in all that, Lena and Ambassador Chen had become friends. United by shared crisis and complementary skills.

"We make a good team," Chen said over terrible station coffee.

"Don't let it go to your head. I still think diplomats are mostly useless."

"And I still think security officers are paranoid. But paranoid and useful work together surprisingly well."

Lena smiled. "To being paranoid and useful."

They clinked their coffee bulbs.

The station rotated through space. Neutral ground. Safe ground.

A place where even enemies could find common cause.

Because safety was universal.

And competence was respected.

Even in a divided solar system.

Especially there.
