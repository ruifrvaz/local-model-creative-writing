Six months after first contact, the colony had settled into rhythm. Production targets met. Research progressing. Communication with Ares evolving from symbolic exchanges into genuine dialogue.

Alexis stood in the command center, reviewing the latest Earth Corp transmission. The message was simple but significant: approval for colony expansion. Twenty additional crew members. Two new habitat modules. Expanded research facilities.

Mars was succeeding.

"They're sending specialists," Rivera said, reading the crew manifest. "Xenobiologists, linguists, cultural anthropologists. Earth Corp is pivoting from extraction to research."

"Because research has better optics than mining." Alexis pulled up the construction timeline. "Two new habs means new foundations. We'll need to survey subsurface conditions before we dig."

"And coordinate with Ares."

"Obviously."

The expansion project began with geological mapping. Omar led the survey team, using ground-penetrating radar and seismic imaging to map the substrate around the existing colony.

What they found changed everything.

"There are more of them," Omar said, showing Alexis the scan results. "Not just Ares. At least seventeen similar cavities within two kilometers of the colony. Different sizes, different thermal signatures, but the same basic structure."

Alexis studied the map. The cavities formed a loose network through the substrate. Some isolated, some connected by thin channels. A community, not a solitary presence.

"Have they been there the whole time?"

"Probably. We just didn't look beyond our immediate foundation area." Omar highlighted the nearest cavity. "This one is three hundred meters from Hab Two. Similar thermal profile to Ares. Likely the same species or... whatever term applies to geothermal intelligences."

"Can we communicate with them?"

"We can try. But if Ares represents one individual in a population, we might be dealing with cultural complexities we're completely unprepared for."

Alexis sent a thermal query to Ares: We have detected other presences. Are they like you?

Ares's response came slowly, as if considering how to translate the concept: Family. Community. Shared existence. Yes.

Family. Alexis felt the implications cascade. They hadn't just made first contact with an individual. They'd established residence in the middle of a populated area. An alien community that predated human presence by millennia.

"We need to disclose this," she told Rivera. "Not just to the crew. To Earth Corp, to the scientific community, to anyone planning colony expansion."

Rivera pulled up the construction timeline. "If we announce we're building in an alien settlement, Earth Corp might halt the expansion."

"If we don't announce it, we're colonizing inhabited territory without consent." Alexis met her gaze. "That's not exploration. That's invasion."

The crew meeting was subdued. Alexis presented the survey data—seventeen presences, an underground community, evidence of complex social structure. The implications were clear.

"We thought we were alone," Yuki said quietly. "We're not. We're surrounded by neighbors we didn't know existed."

"Do they know about us?" someone asked.

Alexis looked at Omar, who shrugged. "Ares knows. Whether it's communicated our presence to the others—we have no data."

"Then we should ask." Yuki stood. "If this is a community, they deserve to know who's moved in. And we deserve to know if our presence is welcome."

The question was harder to translate than Alexis expected. The concept of "permission" or "welcome" didn't map cleanly to Ares's thermal communication. The presence understood need and response, sharing and cooperation. But the social contract of seeking approval before establishing residence seemed foreign.

After three hours of careful exchange, Alexis managed to convey: We wish to expand our presence. Will the community accept this? Or should we seek different location?

Ares's response took longer than any previous communication. Alexis watched the thermal patterns fluctuate, electromagnetic signals modulating in ways she'd learned to interpret as contemplation.

Finally: Community discusses. Wait.

"It's consulting the others," Omar said, awed. "We're witnessing alien political process."

The wait lasted two days. During that time, seismic monitors detected unusual activity in the substrate. Patterns of vibration that seemed to move between the cavities. Communication through the rock itself—a medium humans could barely detect but that Ares's community used fluently.

The colony suspended expansion preparations. Crew members watched the monitoring data, trying to interpret conversations happening in frequencies and media they barely understood.

Alexis spent the time preparing for either outcome. If Ares's community rejected expansion, they'd need to relocate the new habs. If the community approved, they'd need protocols for respectful cohabitation with seventeen alien intelligences.

On the third day, Ares responded: Community accepts presence. Requests awareness of construction processes. Will accommodate expansion if humans communicate plans clearly.

Relief flooded through Alexis. "They said yes."

"With conditions," Rivera noted. "Communication about construction. That means we need to develop technical translation protocols."

"Better than starting a war through misunderstanding."

The expanded communication framework took weeks to develop. Omar worked with Ares to create a shared vocabulary for construction activities. Different thermal patterns for drilling, excavation, foundation placement, structural stress. The alien community learned to interpret human industrial processes. Humans learned to signal their intentions before acting.

It was laborious. Imperfect. But functional.

The construction of Hab Four began with a formal announcement to the subsurface community. Alexis sent thermal pulses describing the project scope, timeline, expected vibrations and thermal disruptions. Ares acknowledged and relayed the information.

Three other presences responded directly. Different thermal signatures, different communication styles. One was terse—almost military in its efficient information exchange. Another was expansive, asking detailed questions about human thermal requirements and structural preferences. The third was cautious, requesting assurances that construction wouldn't destabilize surrounding substrate.

"They're individuals," Omar said, watching the exchanges. "Different personalities, different concerns. This isn't a hive mind—it's a society."

Alexis found herself negotiating with alien presences the way she'd negotiate with Earth contractors. The terse one—she started calling it "Director"—wanted schedules and concrete commitments. The curious one ("Scholar") asked endless questions about human physiology and engineering principles. The cautious one ("Guardian") required stress modeling and safety protocols before approving foundation placement.

It was bureaucracy. Alien bureaucracy, conducted in thermal pulses and seismic vibrations.

And somehow, it worked.

Hab Four's foundation was placed with full community approval. The construction generated vibrations exactly as predicted. The subsurface presences accommodated the disruption without complaint—because they'd been informed, consulted, respected.

The new crew members arrived as construction completed. Among them was Dr. Kenji Nakamura, a xenolinguist who'd spent his career studying theoretical alien communication.

"This is unprecedented," Nakamura said, reviewing the communication logs. "You've established multi-party dialogue with a non-human intelligence network. The linguistic implications alone—"

"Can wait until after we finish teaching them about plumbing systems," Alexis interrupted. "We need to explain why the new hab will discharge thermal waste into the substrate. Guardian is concerned about temperature fluctuations."

Nakamura blinked. "You're doing infrastructure planning with alien oversight."

"We're being respectful neighbors. There's a difference between settling territory and invading someone's home."

Over the following months, the relationship between colony and community deepened. Scholar provided geological data humans couldn't detect—substrate stability patterns, deep water reserves, optimal foundation locations. Director coordinated thermal management, ensuring the colony's heat discharge didn't disrupt community communication channels. Guardian monitored structural stress, warning humans of potential foundation issues before they became critical.

The presences weren't passive. They were active participants in colony development.

"They're teaching us," Yuki said during a research meeting. "Every exchange, every negotiation—we're learning how they think, how they perceive reality, how their society functions."

"And they're learning from us," Nakamura added. "Human concepts of temporal urgency, spatial boundaries, individual agency. We're conducting mutual education."

Alexis watched the monitoring data—seventeen presences, each with distinct thermal signatures, each contributing to the colony's success in different ways. Mars wasn't empty territory waiting for human conquest. It was inhabited by ancient intelligences who'd survived when the planet died, adapted to exist in rock and heat and geological time.

And they were willing to share. To teach. To coexist.

Earth Corp's next transmission praised the colony's "successful integration with indigenous resources." The phrasing made Alexis's teeth clench.

"They're not resources," she told Rivera. "They're people. Well, not people. But sentient beings with rights and agency."

"I know. But Earth Corp won't care about philosophical distinctions." Rivera pulled up the latest directives. "They want us to identify more communities. Map the full extent of Martian subsurface intelligence. Assess—" She paused, reading ahead with visible distaste. "Assess exploitation potential."

"Absolutely not."

"I agree. But we need to manage this carefully. If Earth Corp decides the presences are valuable assets—"

"Then we make it clear they're partners, not property." Alexis leaned forward. "We document every cooperative exchange. Every mutual benefit. We build a case that ethical coexistence is more valuable than exploitation. Because if humanity's first contact with alien intelligence becomes another resource extraction operation—"

"We prove we learned nothing from Earth's mistakes."

They spent the next weeks building documentation. Every instance of community cooperation. Every piece of geological data Scholar provided. Every structural warning from Guardian. Every efficiency gain from thermal management with Director.

The case was compelling: partnership produced better outcomes than conquest.

Earth Corp's board reviewed the data. Their response was cautious but promising: "Continue current protocols. Expand research focus. Exploitation assessment deferred pending long-term viability analysis."

It wasn't a guarantee. But it was breathing room.

Alexis returned to the subsurface tunnel. Ares pulsed steady and calm.

"We're still learning," she said to the presence. "How to be neighbors. How to share worlds. How to see you as equals instead of resources."

Ares's response warmed her: Learning together. Both species. Both growing. Time enough for understanding.

"Yeah," Alexis agreed. "Time enough."

Outside, Mars turned under its thin atmosphere. Two intelligent species—one ancient, one young—sharing a planet and figuring out what that meant.

The universe wasn't empty. It was full of neighbors.

Humanity was finally learning to ask permission before moving in.

And that made all the difference.
