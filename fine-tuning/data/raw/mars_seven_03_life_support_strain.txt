The hydroponics bay smelled like Earth. Wet soil and growing things, chlorophyll and oxygen. Yuki Tanaka breathed it in and let herself pretend, just for a moment, that she wasn't on a dead planet sixty million kilometers from home.

The pretense lasted five seconds. Then the CO2 alarm chimed, and she was back in reality.

"I see it," she said to the empty bay. The sensor array showed elevated carbon dioxide in Section Three. Not dangerous yet, but trending wrong.

Yuki pulled on her work gloves and moved through the rows of wheat. The plants were Earth stock, genetically modified for low light and high CO2 tolerance, but there were limits. Push them too hard and they'd simply stop growing.

The colony couldn't afford that. Not with the supply ship still three months out and the last harvest already showing signs of nutrient deficiency.

She found the problem in Bay Three-C: a failed circulation fan. The blades were caked with mineral deposits from the Martian water supply. Another thing they'd learned the hard way—Mars water needed more filtration than Earth specs required.

Yuki logged the failure and pulled the replacement fan from her tool kit. Twenty minutes of work to swap it out, another ten to calibrate the airflow. Not complicated, just tedious.

Like everything else on Mars.

She was testing the new fan when Alexis appeared in the doorway.

"Got a minute?"

Yuki glanced at the CO2 readings. Dropping. Good enough. "Sure. What's wrong?"

"Besides everything?" Alexis managed a tired smile. "I need your input on the life support expansion. We're getting six new crew members on the next supply run."

"Six? I thought it was four."

"Corporate changed their mind. Again." Alexis pulled up a schematic on her tablet. "Which means we need to increase oxygen production by fifteen percent and water recycling by twelve percent before they arrive."

Yuki looked at the numbers and felt her stomach sink. "That's not possible. Not with our current capacity."

"I know. That's why I need you to tell me what miracles you can pull." Alexis leaned against a support beam. "Because Rivera is getting pressure from Earth, and Earth doesn't accept 'impossible' as an answer."

Yuki walked to her monitoring station and pulled up the life support parameters. The system was already running at ninety-two percent capacity. Adding six more people would push them to one hundred and seven percent.

Which meant failure. Complete, catastrophic, everyone-dies failure.

"We need more algae tanks," she said. "At least two, maybe three."

"We don't have the space."

"Then we make space. Repurpose the recreation area or the secondary storage bay." Yuki ran the calculations. "Three tanks, full capacity, optimized lighting—that gets us the oxygen. The water is trickier."

"How tricky?"

"Very. We're already recycling everything. Shower water, humidity condensation, even urine. There's nothing left to optimize without new equipment." Yuki pulled up the inventory. "We'd need another filtration module. And those don't come cheap."

"Define not cheap."

"Two hundred thousand credits. Plus shipping. Plus installation." Yuki met Alexis's eyes. "And six weeks lead time, minimum."

Alexis was quiet for a long moment. "So we're screwed."

"Unless we convince Earth to delay the new crew until we can expand the system properly." Yuki checked the timeline. "Three months would do it. Six would be safer."

"Rivera already tried. Corporate says the mission timeline is non-negotiable." Alexis rubbed her face. "Something about investor expectations and publicity milestones."

Yuki felt anger flash hot in her chest. "Publicity milestones. They're risking ten lives for publicity."

"Welcome to Mars." Alexis closed her tablet. "Okay, here's what we're going to do. You get me a detailed proposal for the algae tanks. Materials, power requirements, installation timeline. I'll find the space somehow."

"And the water?"

"I'm working on that. There might be an option Hassan mentioned—subsurface ice deposits. If we can tap into that, we bypass the recycling bottleneck entirely."

"If it exists. And if we can drill to it. And if it's not contaminated with perchlorates or other Martian surprises." Yuki shook her head. "That's a lot of ifs."

"It's all we've got." Alexis headed for the door, then paused. "Yuki? Thanks for being honest. I know it's easier to just say 'yes, ma'am' and hope for the best."

"Hope isn't a strategy."

"No. But sometimes it's all we have." Alexis left.

Yuki turned back to her plants. The wheat was growing, slow but steady. Each stalk a small victory against the Martian environment. Each grain of wheat a promise that humans could survive here.

But survival wasn't the same as thriving.

She pulled up the algae tank specifications and began drafting the proposal. Three tanks. Four hundred liters each. LED arrays running twenty hours a day. Power consumption that would strain their already overtaxed solar grid.

Possible, but barely.

The recreation area would have to go. That would make crew morale worse, but dead crew had terrible morale anyway.

Yuki worked through lunch, losing herself in calculations and system diagrams. By evening, she had a proposal that was technically feasible and practically insane.

She sent it to Alexis with a note: "This will work, but nobody's going to like it."

The response came back in thirty seconds: "Story of my life. Good work."

Yuki allowed herself a small smile. At least she wasn't the only one trying to hold this place together with duct tape and determination.

She made one final check of the hydroponics systems—all green—and headed for her quarters. The corridors were quiet, most of the crew already asleep or pretending to be.

In her room, Yuki pulled up the video messages from Earth. Her daughter's latest upload, sent three weeks ago, received yesterday.

"Hi Mom. I got an A on my science project. Ms. Peterson said my presentation on Martian agriculture was the best in the class. She asked if you could do a video call with the class next month. They all want to know what it's like up there."

Yuki's daughter smiled at the camera, gap-toothed and proud. Nine years old. Growing up while Yuki grew plants sixty million kilometers away.

What it's like up there.

Cold. Dangerous. Exhausting. Beautiful in a stark, unforgiving way. Lonely, even surrounded by crew.

But also: important. Necessary. The first step toward making humanity a multi-planet species.

Yuki composed a response, choosing her words carefully. The truth, but not the scary parts. The wonder, but not the constant fear.

"Hi sweetie. I'm so proud of you. Tell Ms. Peterson I'd love to talk to your class. Mars is amazing—we're growing wheat that will help feed the whole colony. Every day we figure out something new about how to live here. It's hard work, but it matters. I love you. Stay curious."

She sent the message and closed her tablet. Six more months. Then she'd rotate back to Earth for three months of leave. Six months to watch her daughter grow up through delayed video messages.

Worth it, she told herself. This mattered.

The wheat mattered. The algae tanks mattered. The six new crew members who were coming whether the life support could handle them or not—they mattered too.

Yuki set her alarm and tried to sleep.

Tomorrow she'd start clearing the recreation area. Start building the tanks. Start making the impossible happen, one small step at a time.

That's what they did here.

The possible was for Earth. Mars demanded miracles.

And Yuki Tanaka was learning to deliver them.
