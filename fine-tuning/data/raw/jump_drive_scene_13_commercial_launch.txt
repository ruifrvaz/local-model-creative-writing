The first commercial FTL vessel launched three years after Lieutenant Sarah Chen's initial jump. Dr. Kenji Yamamoto watched from mission control and felt the weight of everything that had led to this moment.

Forty-three test pilots. Twenty-seven successful adaptations. Sixteen failures ranging from temporary disorientation to permanent coma. Billions in research. Genetic screening programs. Neural shielding protocols. Selective field generators.

All leading to this: A cargo ship preparing to jump from Earth orbit to Mars in three seconds instead of six months.

"All systems green," the jump coordinator reported. "Alcubierre field generators online. Neural shielding active. Pilot reports ready for transition."

The pilot was Lieutenant Yuki Tanaka, one of the genetically-screened volunteers. She'd completed twelve test jumps with minimal fragmentation. Her temporal perception was enhanced but stable. She existed mostly in linear time with occasional probability-wave awareness.

Acceptable adaptation. Functional consciousness. Mission-ready.

"Jump authorization granted," Admiral Kowalski said. "Make history, Lieutenant."

The field activated. Yuki's neural monitors showed the familiar pattern—temporal variance, rapid neural restructuring, consciousness briefly fragmenting then reconsolidating.

Three seconds of FTL travel. The cargo ship emerged at Mars orbit with zero navigation drift.

Perfect.

The control room erupted in applause. Humanity's first commercial faster-than-light voyage. The beginning of practical interplanetary travel. The achievement they'd sacrificed everything to reach.

Kenji watched the celebration and thought about Sarah Chen in her three-meter cage. About Lieutenant Park in his care facility, still comatose after five years. About the sixteen pilots who'd paid costs that numbers and celebrations couldn't capture.

"We did it," Dr. Aisha Mbara said beside him. "Reliable FTL. Genetically-screened pilots. Neural shielding that works. We actually did it."

"At what cost?"

"Acceptable cost. Twenty-seven adapted pilots. Sixteen casualties. That's sixty-three percent success rate. Better than early aviation. Better than early spaceflight."

"Aviation casualties died. Our casualties exist in temporal horror."

"Some do. Others recovered. Park might wake up eventually. The temporal fragmentation isn't necessarily permanent for everyone."

Kenji pulled up Park's latest scans. Five years. No improvement. Consciousness scattered across incompatible timeframes, unable to coalesce into coherent awareness.

"Park is gone. We keep his body alive, but he's not in there anymore. Not in any meaningful sense."

"We don't know that."

"We know enough."

The celebration continued. Commercial FTL was reality. Companies were already planning jump-capable vessels. Mining operations that could reach asteroid belt in seconds. Colony ships that could reach distant worlds in minutes instead of decades.

Humanity's expansion was accelerating.

Built on the neural restructuring of forty-three test pilots who'd volunteered to break causality.

Kenji left the control room and walked to the medical facility. Sarah sat in her selective field generator reading probability waves in quantum physics papers.

"We did it," he said. "First commercial FTL jump successful."

"I know. I experienced it across multiple timeframes already. Saw the celebration. Saw your doubt. Saw humanity reaching for the stars." Sarah set down the paper. "You're questioning whether it was worth the cost."

"Sixteen pilots, Sarah. Sixteen people who didn't adapt. Who exist in states worse than death."

"Sixteen pilots who volunteered knowing the risks. Who chose to push boundaries because expansion matters more than personal comfort." Sarah pulled up the commercial flight data. "Because of them, because of us, humanity can reach Mars in three seconds. Can establish colonies on distant worlds. Can survive beyond Earth."

"Does that justify Park's coma?"

"Ask Park. Oh wait, you can't, because his consciousness is scattered across temporal states. So ask me instead. I paid the cost. I exist in a three-meter cage, experiencing all moments simultaneously, unable to live normally. Was it worth it?"

Kenji met her eyes. Past, present, future gazes overlapping.

"Was it?"

"Yes." No hesitation. "Humanity needed FTL. We provided it. The cost was steep. But the gain is infinite. Every world we reach, every civilization we build, every human who lives beyond Earth—that's our legacy. That's what justifies everything."

"Even if you never leave this cage?"

"Even then. My freedom versus humanity's future? The math is obvious." Sarah smiled across timeframes. "Besides, I experience all moments. I'm already free in futures where miniaturized field generators exist. Where I can travel normally while maintaining temporal consciousness. Those futures are as real as this present."

Kenji wanted to argue. But Sarah existed across probability waves. She'd already experienced this conversation and its outcomes and the futures it would lead to.

"The commercial program is expanding. Twenty more jump-capable vessels in the next year. Fifty the year after. By decade's end, FTL travel will be standard for interplanetary transport."

"And the pilot requirements? Still genetically screening?"

"More thoroughly than ever. We're down to five percent fragmentation rate among screened candidates. Genetic markers predict adaptation success with ninety percent accuracy."

"So we're selecting humans for temporal capability. Creating a genetic class who can navigate FTL while others can't."

"Is that different from selecting pilots for vision? Astronauts for bone density? We've always screened for capability."

"Vision and bone density don't divide humanity into those who experience linear time versus those who exist across all moments simultaneously."

Kenji had to concede the point. They were creating a subspecies. Humans adapted for FTL consciousness. A genetic elite who could fragment across temporal states and reconsolidate functionally.

"What happens when temporal-adapted pilots have children? Do they inherit the neural structures? The temporal consciousness?"

"Unknown. Sarah's biology hasn't stabilized enough for reproduction studies. But theoretically, yes. Temporal adaptation might be heritable."

"Then we're not just selecting pilots. We're engineering a new evolutionary branch. Humans who exist outside linear causality from birth."

"Or we're accelerating natural evolution. These genes already existed in the population. We're just selecting for them and creating environmental pressure that enhances their expression."

Sarah listened to their debate and experienced it across multiple timeframes. This conversation. The same argument a year from now. The resolution a decade hence when temporal-adapted children were born.

"You'll have your answer in six years," she said. "Lieutenant Tanaka gets pregnant. Carries to term while maintaining FTL operations. Her daughter shows temporal awareness from infancy. Develops temporal processing centers before age three. Experiences non-linear causality as normal."

They stared at her.

"You've seen this?" Aisha asked.

"I experience probable futures. That's one of the highest probability timelines. Sixty-seven percent chance of occurring."

"You're telling us FTL adaptation is heritable?"

"I'm telling you one probable future where it is. The timeline might diverge. Tanaka might not get pregnant. The child might develop normally. But probability favors temporal inheritance."

Kenji felt the implications cascade. Heritable temporal consciousness. Children born experiencing all moments simultaneously. A new subspecies emerging from genetic selection and exotic physics exposure.

"We need to study this. Prepare for the possibility. Develop protocols for raising temporally-aware children."

"You have six years," Sarah said. "Assuming that timeline manifests. Start preparing now. You'll need educational frameworks, developmental psychology adapted for non-linear consciousness, social integration strategies."

"You're talking about creating a new category of human."

"I'm talking about acknowledging what we've already created. Temporal adaptation was always going to be heritable. Neurological structures pass to offspring. We just accelerated the process."

The commercial FTL program continued expanding. More jump-capable vessels. More genetically-screened pilots. More successful adaptations to temporal consciousness.

And in six years—or sixty-seven percent probability thereof—the first temporally-aware child would be born.

Humanity was diverging. Linear humans and temporal humans. Two consciousnesses experiencing reality differently. Two evolutionary paths diverging from common ancestry.

The cost of faster-than-light travel wasn't just neural restructuring. It was speciation. Humanity branching into subspecies adapted for different experiences of causality.

Sarah Chen had been first. A prototype. A warning. A promise.

Now that promise was becoming reality.

Humanity would reach the stars. Part of humanity would exist across all moments while doing so.

The question wasn't whether that was worth the cost. The transformation was already happening.

The question was whether linear humans and temporal humans could coexist. Whether two different experiences of causality could share the same civilization.

Sarah knew the answer. She existed across all probable futures. Saw timelines where coexistence worked and timelines where it failed catastrophically.

But telling them wouldn't help. Some futures had to be lived. Not predicted.

Even for someone who experienced all moments simultaneously.

Especially for her.

Because knowing the future didn't change the necessity of living through it.

One temporal moment at a time.

Or all moments simultaneously.

Depending on which subspecies you belonged to.
