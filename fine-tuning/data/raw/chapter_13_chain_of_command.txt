The war room was really just a converted storage bay, but it served its purpose. Tactical displays lined the walls, showing real-time data from every sensor the Meridian possessed.

Admiral Torres appeared via quantum-entangled hologram, her image flickering slightly from the distance. Behind her, Elena could see the military command center on Earth—crisp uniforms, gleaming equipment, the machinery of human power.

"Captain Reeves," Torres said. "Explain to me why you're still in proximity to the anomaly."

"We've established communication, Admiral. First contact protocols—"

"Your orders were to observe and wait for Fleet assets."

"With respect, Admiral, waiting was killing us. The anomaly was degrading our hull integrity." Elena pulled up the data. "We had to engage or die."

Torres studied the readings. Her expression didn't change. "And now?"

"Now we're talking. It's shown us its history, its technology. It's answered questions we didn't know we had."

"It's also the entity responsible for Phobos."

"No, ma'am. We were responsible for Phobos." Elena let that hang in the air. "The anomaly attempted first contact. Our systems weren't prepared. The AI misinterpreted the neural interface as an attack and initiated emergency protocols."

"You're speculating."

"I'm reading the data your own people classified." Elena transmitted the files. "Jessica Martinez, reactor technician. She reported unusual AI behavior three days before the catastrophe. Command dismissed it."

Torres was quiet for a long moment. "Those reports were deemed unreliable."

"They were accurate. And three hundred people died because no one listened."

"Captain, you're out of line."

"I'm out of time, Admiral." Elena gestured at the hull stress readings. "We have eight hours before our ship comes apart. Eight hours to understand what we're dealing with and how to communicate safely."

"Then pull back. Disengage. Let the specialists handle this."

"The specialists aren't here. We are." Elena leaned forward. "Admiral, this is first contact with an intelligence older than human civilization. We can't afford to get it wrong again."

Torres's hologram shimmered. "Captain Reeves, I am giving you a direct order. Withdraw to safe distance and maintain observation only. Fleet assets arrive in eighteen days. You will wait."

"Eighteen days, we'll be dead or gone. The anomaly won't wait that long."

"That's not your decision to make."

"Actually, ma'am, it is." Elena straightened. "I'm the ranking officer on scene. First contact protocols give me discretionary authority."

"Don't cite regulations at me, Captain. I wrote half of them."

"Then you know I'm right."

Torres glared through the hologram. For a moment, Elena thought she'd push it—court-martial, immediate relief of command, the end of her career.

Instead, Torres said, "Eight hours. If you're not out of there by then, I'll have you dragged back in chains."

"Understood, Admiral."

"And Reeves? If you get my people killed, there won't be enough of you left to court-martial."

The hologram cut out.

Marcus whistled low. "That went well."

"Could've been worse." Elena checked the tactical display. "She could've ordered us to fire on it."

"Give her time."

Elena pulled up the communication logs with the anomaly. They were running out of time for subtlety. If they were going to get answers about Phobos, about what the anomaly wanted, about what happened to Katie—they needed to ask directly.

"Patel," she said over comms. "Prepare a focused query. I want to know what happened to my sister."

"Captain, that's... that's personal."

"That's the point. If this thing can understand human emotion, human loss, then maybe it can understand why we're so scared." Elena activated her neural link. "And maybe it can help us stop being afraid."

The query went out, carrying with it all the weight of grief Elena had been holding for three years.

In the dark beyond the hull, the anomaly listened.

And for the first time, it offered something that might have been sympathy.
