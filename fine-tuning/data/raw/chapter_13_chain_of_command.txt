The war room was really just a converted storage bay, but it served its purpose. Tactical displays lined the walls, showing real-time data from every sensor the Meridian possessed.

Admiral Torres appeared via quantum-entangled hologram, her image flickering slightly from the distance. Behind her, Elena could see the military command center on Earth—crisp uniforms, gleaming equipment, the machinery of human power.

So far away. So impossibly far from understanding what was happening out here.

"Captain Reeves," Torres said. "Explain to me why you're still in proximity to the anomaly."

"We've established communication, Admiral. First contact protocols—"

"Your orders were to observe and wait for Fleet assets."

"With respect, Admiral, waiting was killing us. The anomaly was degrading our hull integrity." Elena pulled up the data. "We had to engage or die."

Torres studied the readings. Her expression didn't change. Military discipline. Command face. Elena recognized it because she wore the same mask.

"And now?"

"Now we're talking. It's shown us its history, its technology. It's answered questions we didn't know we had."

"It's also the entity responsible for Phobos."

"No, ma'am. We were responsible for Phobos." Elena let that hang in the air. "The anomaly attempted first contact. Our systems weren't prepared. The AI misinterpreted the neural interface as an attack and initiated emergency protocols."

"You're speculating."

"I'm reading the data your own people classified." Elena transmitted the files. "Jessica Martinez, reactor technician. She reported unusual AI behavior three days before the catastrophe. Command dismissed it."

Torres was quiet for a long moment. "Those reports were deemed unreliable."

"They were accurate. And three hundred people died because no one listened."

The hologram flickered, disrupted by quantum interference from the anomaly's presence. Torres's face fragmented and reformed.

"Captain, you're out of line."

"I'm out of time, Admiral." Elena gestured at the hull stress readings. "We have eight hours before our ship comes apart. Eight hours to understand what we're dealing with and how to communicate safely."

"Then pull back. Disengage. Let the specialists handle this."

"The specialists aren't here. We are." Elena leaned forward. "Admiral, this is first contact with an intelligence older than human civilization. We can't afford to get it wrong again."

Torres's hologram shimmered. "Captain Reeves, I am giving you a direct order. Withdraw to safe distance and maintain observation only. Fleet assets arrive in eighteen days. You will wait."

"Eighteen days, we'll be dead or gone. The anomaly won't wait that long."

"That's not your decision to make."

"Actually, ma'am, it is." Elena straightened. "I'm the ranking officer on scene. First contact protocols give me discretionary authority."

"Don't cite regulations at me, Captain. I wrote half of them."

"Then you know I'm right."

Torres glared through the hologram. For a moment, Elena thought she'd push it—court-martial, immediate relief of command, the end of her career.

She'd worn two stars for seven years. Lost them in seven seconds if it meant saving her crew.

Instead, Torres said, "Eight hours. If you're not out of there by then, I'll have you dragged back in chains."

"Understood, Admiral."

"And Reeves? If you get my people killed, there won't be enough of you left to court-martial."

The hologram cut out.

Marcus whistled low. "That went well."

"Could've been worse." Elena checked the tactical display. "She could've ordered us to fire on it."

"Give her time."

Elena pulled up the communication logs with the anomaly. They were running out of time for subtlety. If they were going to get answers about Phobos, about what the anomaly wanted, about what happened to Katie—they needed to ask directly.

"Patel," she said over comms. "Prepare a focused query. I want to know what happened to my sister."

"Captain, that's... that's personal."

"That's the point. If this thing can understand human emotion, human loss, then maybe it can understand why we're so scared." Elena activated her neural link. "And maybe it can help us stop being afraid."

The query went out, carrying with it all the weight of grief Elena had been holding for three years.

Katie's face. Katie's voice. Katie's last transmission before the static claimed her.

In the dark beyond the hull, the anomaly listened.

And for the first time, it offered something that might have been sympathy.

The response came not in mathematics, but in images. Katie. Young, smiling, reaching out with wonder instead of fear. The anomaly had tried to show her the universe. Had tried to share knowledge, perspective, understanding.

And humanity's crude technology had killed her for it.

Elena watched the data stream, tears she didn't remember shedding cooling on her cheeks.

"I understand," she whispered. "You didn't mean to hurt her."

The anomaly pulsed. Agreement. Regret. Determination to do better.

Just like Elena.

Marcus stood beside her, silent. Giving her the moment. He'd known Katie too—had served with her briefly before Phobos. Before everything changed.

"Captain," he said finally. "What do we do now?"

Elena wiped her face, straightened her uniform. The weight of command settled back onto her shoulders like a familiar burden.

"Now we teach it how to talk to us without killing us." She pulled up the neural integration protocols Chen had sent. "And we make sure Katie's death meant something."

"Torres won't like it."

"Torres isn't here." Elena looked at the anomaly through the viewport. Ancient. Patient. Willing to learn. "Besides, we've got eight hours. Plenty of time to save the world."

Marcus smiled despite himself. "Or doom it."

"There's that too." Elena activated the shipwide comm. "All hands, this is the captain. We're attempting full neural contact with the anomaly in six hours. Use the time to prepare. Chen, I want every crew member scanned and monitored. Patel, refine the contact protocols. Marcus, you have the bridge. I'll be in my quarters reviewing the integration data."

She left before he could object. In her quarters, Elena pulled up every piece of information they had on neural interfaces, quantum communication, and the anomaly's patterns.

Somewhere in this data was the key to making first contact work.

She had six hours to find it.

Katie had died trying. Elena wouldn't waste that sacrifice.

The anomaly pulsed in her neural feed, constant now. A presence she was learning to recognize.

Almost like a friend.

Almost like hope.
