Captain Ana Reyes stood before the council chamber, waiting for the vote that would define her generation.

Turn back to Proxima Centauri or continue to Tau Ceti.

The debate had raged for three months. Every department had weighed in. Engineering showed the ship could survive either choice. Medical presented genetic viability models. Agriculture calculated resource sustainability.

Now it came down to philosophy. Purpose. Identity.

"The vote will now proceed," Eva Sato announced. "All those in favor of altering course to Proxima Centauri?"

Hands rose. Malik Torres. Dr. Amanda Foster. Lieutenant Sarah Kim. Others from the younger generations and the awakened sleepers.

Fifteen hands total.

"All those in favor of maintaining our original course to Tau Ceti?"

More hands. Captain Reyes herself. Eva Sato. James Okoye. Most of the second and third generation colonists.

Eighteen hands.

"The motion fails. We continue to Tau Ceti."

Malik slumped in his seat. Sarah Kim looked furious. Dr. Foster shook her head in disappointment.

"However," Eva continued, "the council acknowledges the concerns raised about genetic viability and population sustainability. We therefore authorize expanded sleeper revival, increased resource allocation for family support programs, and development of contingency plans should our population decline below safe thresholds."

It was a compromise. Not satisfying anyone completely, but allowing everyone to claim partial victory.

The meeting dissolved. Reyes watched her crew file out, seeing the division clearly. Those who believed in the original mission. Those who thought pragmatism should override mythology. Those caught between both positions.

A ship divided.

Malik found her in the observation deck hours later.

"Captain. We need to talk."

"About the vote?"

"About what happens next." Malik gestured at the star field. "We just told forty percent of the crew that their concerns don't matter. That tradition outweighs survival. You realize what that does to morale?"

"I realize we made a decision based on democratic process. The majority voted to continue."

"The majority from established generations. The sleepers and younger crew voted almost unanimously to turn back. We're creating a generational rift."

"We've always had generational differences. That's inevitable on a four-hundred-year voyage."

"This is different. This is fundamental disagreement about our purpose." Malik pulled up population projections. "Captain, if the genetic trends continue, by generation six we'll need external genetic material. There won't be a viable population to reach Tau Ceti."

"Medical is working on solutions. Gene therapy, carefully managed breeding programs, possible cloning technologies."

"Assuming any of that works. Assuming we develop the technology in time. That's a lot of assumptions stacked against hard mathematics."

Reyes turned to face him. "Malik, I understand your frustration. But this mission was designed to reach Tau Ceti. Everyone who signed on—your ancestors, my ancestors—agreed to that goal. We don't abandon it because the path got harder."

"My ancestors signed on. I didn't. Nobody born on this ship chose this mission."

There it was. The core issue. Inherited obligation versus personal choice.

"You're right," Reyes said quietly. "You didn't choose this. Neither did I. We were born into a mission we'll never see completed. That's the burden of generational voyages."

"It doesn't have to be. We could choose our own path. Make our own decisions."

"And abandon the sacrifices of seven generations? Dishonor everyone who came before?"

"Or honor them by surviving. By adapting. By being smarter than rigid adherence to a plan written four hundred years ago."

They stood in silence, the argument reaching its inevitable impasse. Two worldviews, incompatible and irreconcilable.

Finally, Reyes spoke. "The decision is made. We continue to Tau Ceti. But Malik, I want you to lead the contingency planning. If the genetic situation deteriorates, I want options ready. Real, viable options that don't compromise our primary mission."

"And if those options don't exist?"

"Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Together. As a crew."

Malik nodded slowly. "I'll develop the contingencies. But Captain, understand—this debate isn't over. It'll resurface every time we face a crisis. Every time someone dies young or a child is born with genetic disorders. The question will keep coming: was this mission worth the cost?"

"I know. And each generation will have to answer it for themselves."

After Malik left, Reyes stayed in the observation deck, looking at the stars.

Two hundred three years to Tau Ceti. Twenty-one generations remaining. Could the ship stay unified that long? Could a purpose hold for four hundred years when each generation questioned it?

She didn't know.

But she knew her duty. Captain of a generation ship. Guardian of a mission that transcended any single life.

Even if that mission destroyed her crew in the process.

The thought haunted her through the night.

Dr. James Okoye found her still in the observation deck at dawn cycle.

"Couldn't sleep?" he asked.

"Kept thinking about Malik's arguments. He's not wrong, James. The genetic situation is precarious."

"But manageable. The sleeper revival program is helping. Birth rates are stabilizing. We're not in crisis yet."

"Yet. That word does a lot of work."

Okoye sat beside her. "Ana, every generation of this ship has faced existential questions. The first generation dealt with leaving Earth behind. The second with being born in space. The third with never knowing planetary life. We're facing genetics. The tenth generation will face something else. That's the nature of the voyage."

"And if we fail? If we don't make it to Tau Ceti?"

"Then future archaeologists will find a derelict ship drifting between stars. Evidence that humanity tried and failed." Okoye smiled sadly. "But Ana, every human endeavor risks failure. We try anyway. That's what makes us human."

"I wish I had your certainty."

"I don't have certainty. I have faith. Not in God or destiny, but in human stubbornness. We're too proud to fail at something we've invested four hundred years pursuing."

Reyes laughed despite herself. "That's your medical opinion? Human pride will save us?"

"It's saved us so far. From planetary extinction, from resource depletion, from our own tendency toward self-destruction. Pride keeps us going when logic says quit."

"I hope you're right."

"Me too. Because if I'm wrong, we're all in trouble."

The ship rotated through its artificial day, crew members waking to their routines. Children heading to education modules. Engineers maintaining systems. Agriculture workers tending plants. Medical staff monitoring health data.

Life continuing, generation after generation. Each person a tiny part of a project that would outlive them by centuries.

Reyes watched them through the observation window and felt the weight of command.

These people trusted her. To lead. To decide. To navigate impossible choices.

She'd voted to continue to Tau Ceti because she believed in the mission. Because she'd been raised believing in it. Because abandoning it felt like betraying everyone who'd come before.

But Malik's words haunted her. "I didn't choose this."

Had she chosen it? Or had she just accepted what she'd been taught to believe?

The question had no easy answer.

So Reyes did what captains always did. She pushed the doubts aside, straightened her uniform, and went to work.

The mission continued. Questions remained. Divisions persisted.

But the ship flew on.

Toward Tau Ceti. Or toward disaster. Or toward something no one had anticipated.

Time would tell.

Reyes just had to make sure they survived long enough to find out.

That was enough.

For today.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges.

But tomorrow always did.

That's what four hundred years meant.

Challenges without end.

Until arrival.

Or oblivion.

Whichever came first.
