Malik Torres found the vote counter in his quarters at midnight. Someone had slipped it under his door—a small device that tracked the upcoming referendum. The numbers glowed red in the darkness.

Abandon Mission: 3,847 votes  
Continue Mission: 2,112 votes  
Undecided: 1,203 votes

The generation ship Endeavor was tearing itself apart. Not structurally—the hull integrity was fine. But socially, philosophically, the crew was fracturing along lines that twenty years ago hadn't existed.

Malik turned the counter over in his hands. Forty-two percent wanted to abort the mission. Stop the ship. Settle on Kepler-442b, a marginal world that might support human life. Might.

Two hundred years of travel. Two hundred more to go. And nearly half the ship was ready to quit.

He pulled up the planet data on his terminal. Kepler-442b wasn't the target. It was never supposed to be. Gravity fourteen percent higher than Earth. Atmosphere thin. Surface temperature averaging minus twenty Celsius. Survival would be possible. Thriving would be hard.

But it was there. Real. Visible through the ship's telescopes. Not a promise four hundred years away.

His door chimed. Eva Sato stood in the corridor, her historian's tablet clutched against her chest.

"You saw the numbers," she said.

"I saw them." Malik gestured her inside. "When did the vote get scheduled?"

"Yesterday. Captain Reyes authorized it under the Democratic Governance Charter. If fifty percent plus one vote to change course, we change course." Eva sat heavily. "Malik, we can't let this happen."

"Can't let democracy happen? That's rich coming from a historian."

"Democracy works when people understand what they're voting for. Half this ship has never seen Earth. Never experienced real gravity. They think Kepler-442b is salvation because it's tangible." She pulled up images of the planet. "But it's not Earth. It's not even close."

"And our actual target is?"

"A statistical probability. Proxima Centauri b, estimated seventy percent Earth-like. But we won't know for sure until we arrive. Two hundred years from now." Eva's voice was tight. "Our generation won't see it. Our children won't see it. Maybe our grandchildren, if we're lucky."

Malik looked at the vote counter. The numbers were climbing. Even as they spoke, people were choosing immediate hardship over delayed reward.

"Maybe they're right," he said quietly. "Maybe we're the crazy ones. Sacrificing our lives for a destination we'll never reach."

"Our ancestors sacrificed everything so we could continue. They left Earth knowing they'd die in transit. That was the deal."

"A deal they made. Not us." Malik pulled up the ship's genetic records. "Eva, look at this. Our gene pool is degrading. Inbreeding depression. Recessive disorders appearing in the third generation that weren't supposed to manifest for another hundred years. Medical predicts genetic viability drops below sustainable thresholds in seventy-five years."

Eva went pale. "That's not public data."

"No. But it's real data. And it means even if we continue, we might not survive the journey." He closed the file. "Maybe Kepler-442b is our only chance. Fresh genetic input from whatever we find there. Adaptation to a new environment instead of slow extinction in a metal tube."

"You're advocating for abandoning the mission."

"I'm advocating for survival. There's a difference."

Eva stood. "I thought you understood. The mission isn't about us. It's about preserving humanity's future. Earth is dying—was dying when we left. If we quit now, if we settle for marginal survival on a harsh world, we doom every generation that comes after to subsistence existence."

"And if we continue, we doom ourselves to extinction before we arrive." Malik met her eyes. "You want to preserve Earth's legacy? Start by preserving Earth's people. The ones actually alive right now."

"That's short-term thinking."

"That's reality. Long-term plans don't matter if we're all dead."

Eva left without another word. Malik watched the door close and felt the weight of the decision settle on his shoulders.

His comm chimed. Dr. James Okoye, the medical director.

"Torres, we need to talk. Privately."

They met in Medical Bay Three, away from the main facilities. Okoye looked exhausted—the expression of someone who'd been fighting a losing battle.

"The genetic degradation report," Malik said.

"Was leaked. Probably by someone in my department who thought the crew deserved to know." Okoye pulled up a holographic DNA strand. "It's worse than the official report states. We have fifty years, not seventy-five. After that, genetic viability collapses completely."

"Can we fix it?"

"With a population of ten thousand? No. We need genetic diversity we don't have. Earth sent us with careful selection, but not enough. They underestimated the drift." Okoye highlighted mutation clusters. "These appeared naturally. These are radiation-induced from cosmic ray exposure. These are from environmental factors we didn't anticipate. All of them compound over generations."

"So Kepler-442b is our only option."

"Or we turn back to Earth."

Malik laughed bitterly. "Turn back. Two hundred years of travel, start over, arrive at a planet that might not even exist anymore. That's your solution?"

"I don't have solutions. I have data. And the data says continuing this mission kills us all eventually." Okoye closed the display. "But there's another option no one's discussing."

"Which is?"

"We split. Half the ship continues to Proxima Centauri. Half diverts to Kepler-442b. The generation ship was designed modular—we can separate into two independent vessels. Both missions continue. Both groups get what they want."

Malik stared at him. "Split the population? Five thousand people per ship? That makes the genetic problem worse."

"For both groups, yes. But it also doubles our chances. One destination fails, maybe the other succeeds. It's risk distribution." Okoye pulled up the engineering schematics. "The separation is technically feasible. Politically complicated. But possible."

"Captain Reyes would never authorize it."

"Captain Reyes is bound by the Democratic Governance Charter. If the crew votes for separation, she has to comply." Okoye met his eyes. "I'm not advocating for this. I'm presenting options. Because what we're doing now—fighting over a single choice—is tearing us apart anyway."

Malik looked at the schematic. Two ships. Two destinies. Two groups of humans diverging into separate evolutionary paths.

It was insane. It was desperate. It was possibly the only way they all survived.

"I need to think about this," he said.

"Think fast. The vote is in forty-eight hours. Once it passes, the decision is locked for five years under the governance charter. We change course or we don't. There's no middle ground unless we create one."

Okoye left. Malik stood in the medical bay, surrounded by machines that kept fragile human bodies alive in the hostile environment of deep space.

His comm chimed again. This time it was a ship-wide alert. Captain Reyes calling an assembly. All crew to the main auditorium in one hour.

The fight was about to become public.

And Malik had to decide which side he was on—or whether he'd propose a third option that might save them all or split them irreparably.

He looked at the vote counter one more time. The numbers were still climbing.

Four thousand votes for abandonment now. The momentum was building.

In forty-eight hours, everything would change.

Malik just had to figure out how to make sure they all survived the change.
