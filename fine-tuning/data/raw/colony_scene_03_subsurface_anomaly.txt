Dr. Omar Hassan's hands were steady as he positioned the core sample under the spectrometer. Three months of subsurface drilling, and the data still didn't make sense.

"Run the isotope analysis again," he said.

His assistant, Jennifer Park, looked up from her terminal. "This is the fourth time. The results aren't going to change."

"Then I need to understand why they're wrong."

The spectrometer hummed, processing the Martian regolith sample. Omar pulled up the comparative data—chemical composition, isotope ratios, crystalline structure. Everything pointed to the same impossible conclusion.

This rock was younger than it should be.

Not by a little. By billions of years.

"Could be contamination," Jennifer said. "Maybe something from the drilling equipment."

"I used three different drill sites. Three separate sets of equipment. All sterilized according to protocol." Omar highlighted the isotope decay patterns. "The contamination would have to be uniform across all samples. That's statistically impossible."

"Then what are we looking at?"

Omar pulled up the geological timeline. Mars's crust was ancient, dating back four billion years to the planet's formation. But these samples showed formation dates of less than two billion years. Recent, by planetary standards.

Impossible, by any standard.

"I'm looking at data that says this section of subsurface was completely replaced sometime in Mars's history." He zoomed in on the crystalline structure. "Melted, reformed, and cooled. Like something turned this region molten and let it solidify again."

"Impact event?"

"Would have to be massive. Bigger than anything in the crater record." Omar pulled up the topographical surveys. "And there's no surface evidence. No impact basin, no ejecta field, nothing."

Jennifer was quiet for a moment. "Could it be volcanic?"

"Mars went volcanically dormant hundreds of millions of years ago. These formations are more recent." He ran the calculations again. "Whatever caused this happened well after Mars should have been geologically dead."

The lab's environmental systems hummed in the silence. Omar stared at the data, trying to find an explanation that didn't violate everything they knew about planetary geology.

"What if we're reading it wrong?" Jennifer asked. "Maybe the isotope ratios don't mean what we think they mean. Different planetary conditions, different decay rates—"

"I've accounted for that. Martian gravity, radiation exposure, temperature variations. The math still says these rocks are too young."

Omar saved the analysis and pulled up the drilling location on the colony map. Three sites, all within five hundred meters of the main habitat. All showing the same anomalous readings.

They'd chosen this location for the colony because the geological surveys showed stable bedrock, low seismic activity, and accessible subsurface ice. Nothing in the preliminary data had suggested anything unusual.

But the preliminary data had been surface scans and orbital surveys. Nobody had drilled this deep until they'd started the ice extraction operations.

"I need to go deeper," Omar said.

"How much deeper?"

"Thirty meters. Maybe forty. I need to find where the anomalous layer ends and the normal crust begins."

Jennifer pulled up the drilling schedule. "We're using all available equipment for water extraction. Commander Rivera's not going to authorize exploratory drilling when we're already stretched thin on resources."

"This isn't just scientific curiosity. If there's active geology we don't understand, it could affect structural stability. Foundation integrity. The whole colony's safety."

"You think this is dangerous?"

Omar looked at the isotope data. Something had melted billions of tons of Martian bedrock and reformed it into crystalline patterns that shouldn't exist. And they'd built their colony right on top of it.

"I think we need to know more before we can answer that question."

He composed a report for Commander Rivera, keeping the language cautious. Anomalous geological formations. Requires further investigation. Potential implications for long-term structural planning.

He didn't mention the impossible age of the rocks. Didn't mention that every sample suggested Mars had been geologically active millions of years after it should have been dead. That information would trigger questions he couldn't answer, and probably a panic he couldn't control.

Better to gather more data first.

The report sent, Omar returned to the samples. He ran a mineral composition analysis, looking for trace elements that might explain the formation. Exotic materials, meteoritic inclusions, anything that could account for the unusual properties.

The results showed standard Martian regolith. Iron oxides, silicon compounds, trace perchlorates. Nothing unusual except the age.

"Run a magnetic resonance scan," he told Jennifer. "Look for subsurface structures. Anything that doesn't match the expected geology."

While the scan processed, Omar pulled up the colony's foundation reports. They'd drilled support pilings down twenty meters, anchoring the habitat domes to bedrock. Standard practice for Martian construction.

But if that bedrock had properties they didn't understand, if there was active geology still happening beneath them, those foundations might not be as stable as they thought.

The magnetic resonance data came back. Omar stared at the display, not quite believing what he was seeing.

"That's not possible," Jennifer said.

"Add it to the list."

The subsurface scan showed a network of hollow spaces—chambers, tunnels, something regular and geometric. Not natural cave formations. Not random voids in the rock.

Structures.

"Could be lava tubes," Jennifer suggested. "Collapsed and reformed during the geological event."

"Lava tubes don't form geometric patterns." Omar highlighted the scan. "Look at the spacing. The symmetry. That's artificial."

"Artificial? You're saying someone built something under our colony?"

"I'm saying the data shows structures that don't match any natural geological process." Omar pulled up the colony blueprints, overlaying them with the scan. "And we're sitting right on top of them."

He needed to tell Rivera. Needed to tell someone. But the implications were staggering—evidence of artificial structures on Mars, hidden beneath the surface, constructed by unknown builders at an impossible time in the planet's history.

Or his instruments were malfunctioning. Or he was misinterpreting the data. Or there was a perfectly rational explanation he just hadn't thought of yet.

Omar ran the scan again, double-checking the calibration. The results were identical.

Geometric voids. Regular spacing. Artificial construction.

He saved everything to an encrypted file and locked his terminal. This needed careful thought, careful verification. One geologist making wild claims about ancient Martian structures would be dismissed as equipment malfunction or professional delusion.

He needed proof. Needed more data. Needed to drill down to those chambers and see what was really there.

And he needed to do it without triggering a colony-wide panic or a corporate shutdown of his research.

Omar pulled up the drilling permit requests. He'd need authorization, equipment, personnel. All scarce resources in a colony running on minimal margins.

But if there was something down there—something that had reshaped Mars's geology millions of years after the planet should have been dead—then they needed to know.

Before it reshaped their colony too.
