Ten years after the first successful FTL jump, Dr. Emma Torres presented findings that changed everything. Not about jump mechanics. About what temporal consciousness did to human society.

"We have two populations now," she told the assembled researchers. "Linear humans and temporal humans. They're diverging faster than anyone predicted."

Dr. Aisha Mbara pulled up the demographic data. "One thousand three hundred temporal-adapted pilots. Four hundred seventy-two temporal-born children. Projected growth reaching ten thousand within five years."

"That's not divergence. That's normal population growth."

"Look at the social patterns." Emma highlighted behavioral studies. "Temporal humans cluster together. Form communities. Develop communication methods linear humans can't follow. They're not just different neurologically. They're becoming culturally distinct."

Admiral Kowalski, now retired but still attending research briefings, leaned forward. "Define 'culturally distinct.'"

"Temporal humans communicate across probability waves. They experience conversations in non-linear time. Past discussion, present exchange, future resolution all happening simultaneously. Linear humans can't participate in that communication mode."

"So there's a language barrier?"

"More fundamental than language. There's an experiential barrier. Temporal humans experience reality that linear humans can't perceive. The gap is unbridgeable through normal socialization."

Dr. Kenji Yamamoto pulled up longitudinal studies. "We're seeing increasing separation. Temporal humans preferring temporal communities. Temporal children struggling in linear education systems. Temporal adults requesting specialized housing with shared field generators."

"They're self-segregating," Aisha said quietly.

"They're clustering around shared experience. Same thing any demographic group does." Emma pulled up the social network analysis. "But yes. The effect is segregation. Two populations experiencing reality differently, unable to fully communicate, choosing to exist separately."

Kowalski studied the data. "This is a political problem. We can't have humanity splitting into subspecies that don't interact."

"We already have that. The split happened the moment Sarah Chen adapted to temporal consciousness. We've been managing the growth ever since."

"Then we manage the integration. Create programs where temporal and linear humans work together. Educational systems that accommodate both experiential frameworks. Prevent separation from becoming permanent."

Emma pulled up the program results. "We've tried. Temporal children in linear schools become isolated. Can't form friendships with peers who experience time differently. Linear adults working with temporal colleagues report communication breakdown. The experiential gap is too large."

"What about Sarah? She maintains relationships with linear humans."

"Sarah is exceptional. She adapted as an adult. Remembers linear experience. Can translate between frameworks." Emma highlighted the temporal-born population. "Children born temporal have no linear reference point. They've never experienced causality as sequential. To them, our linear existence is as alien as their temporal omniscience is to us."

The implications were staggering. Humanity diverging into incompatible populations. Not through geography or ideology, but through fundamental difference in experiencing reality.

"We need to study this," Kenji said. "Understand the social dynamics. Develop frameworks for coexistence."

"We need to prevent permanent separation," Kowalski countered. "Maintain human unity despite neurological differences."

"Those might be incompatible goals. Unity requires shared experience. Temporal and linear humans don't share experience. They share genetics, history, planetary origin. But not present reality."

The research program expanded. Social scientists studying temporal communities. Educators developing dual-framework schools. Politicians debating integration policies.

Sarah Chen, now fifteen years post-adaptation, watched the debates from her three-meter cage and experienced the outcomes across all probable timelines.

"They're trying to prevent what's already happened," she told Yuki Tanaka during a visit.

Yuki, still piloting commercial FTL runs, nodded. "The separation is inevitable?"

"The separation is natural. We experience reality differently. Linear humans live in sequential moments. We exist across all moments simultaneously. You can't force those experiences to integrate."

"So we're destined to become separate species?"

"Species, subspecies, demographic groups—terminology doesn't matter. The experiential gap does." Sarah pulled up social predictions. "In seventy-two percent of futures, temporal humans form independent communities within twenty years. Separate governance. Separate cultural institutions. Minimal interaction with linear populations."

"And in the other twenty-eight percent?"

"Integration attempts fail violently. Political movements to restrict temporal births. Discrimination against temporal-conscious individuals. Social breakdown."

Yuki held her daughter Akari, now five years old and experiencing multiple temporal states while playing with probability-wave toys. "What do you recommend?"

"Accept the divergence. Stop forcing integration. Let temporal humans form their own communities while maintaining peaceful coexistence with linear populations." Sarah met Yuki's eyes across timeframes. "Separation isn't failure. It's acknowledgment of different experiential needs."

The research findings supported Sarah's analysis. Temporal humans thrived in temporal communities. Struggled in linear integration. Forcing interaction increased stress without improving understanding.

Dr. Torres presented the findings to government officials. "We recommend establishing temporal settlements. Communities designed for non-linear consciousness. Shared field generator infrastructure. Educational systems accommodating temporal awareness. Separate but cooperative with linear society."

"That's segregation," one official said.

"That's accommodation for different neurological configurations. Like providing wheelchair ramps for mobility-impaired individuals. Except temporal difference is more fundamental than physical disability."

"This sets precedent for human subspecies. For permanent separation based on biological configuration."

"The precedent was set when we developed FTL travel. We created neurological divergence. Now we're managing the social consequences."

The debate consumed months. Politics, ethics, sociology colliding with neurological reality. Eventually, pragmatism won.

Temporal settlements were authorized. The first established on Mars—ironic that humanity's expansion created the population requiring specialized communities. Then settlements on Europa, Titan, orbital stations designed for temporal consciousness.

Temporal humans migrated to these communities. Found others experiencing reality non-linearly. Formed societies around shared temporal awareness.

Linear humans maintained traditional communities. Sequential time. Causal progression. Normal human experience.

The two populations coexisted. Traded. Communicated through specially-trained intermediaries who could translate between experiential frameworks. Remained genetically compatible but culturally divergent.

Sarah watched the separation complete across multiple timelines. Saw futures where it worked well. Futures where tensions emerged. Futures where temporal and linear humans forgot their common origin.

All probable. All already existing in her omniscient awareness.

"Do you regret it?" Kenji asked during one of his visits. "Being the first? Starting this divergence?"

Sarah experienced the question across all moments. Regret in some. Pride in others. Acceptance throughout.

"I regret the suffering. Mine, David Chen's, all the pilots who fragmented catastrophically. But I don't regret the outcome. Humanity needed expansion. We achieved it. The cost was speciation. That's evolution."

"Evolution usually takes millennia."

"Technology accelerates everything. Including evolution." Sarah pulled up the demographic projections. "Within a century, temporal humans will outnumber linear humans in space-based populations. Within two centuries, they'll be the dominant consciousness in human-settled space."

"And linear humans?"

"Will remain on Earth and inner planets. Live sequential lives. Maintain human baseline. Both populations will be human. Just different expressions of humanity."

Kenji looked at the data. At the inexorable mathematics of divergence. At the future Sarah had experienced across all probable timelines.

"We changed what it means to be human."

"We changed what it means to experience reality. Humanity adapts. Always has. Fire, agriculture, industrialization, spaceflight, FTL travel. Each advancement changes baseline capabilities. This change just happened faster than most."

"Because we forced it."

"Because we needed it. The alternative was stagnation. Limited planetary resources. Extinction risk. We chose expansion. Expansion required FTL. FTL required temporal adaptation. The chain was inevitable once we committed to the first link."

She was right. Every decision had cascaded into consequences beyond prediction. Sarah's first jump. The adaptation. The genetic screening. The temporal births. The social divergence.

All connected. All necessary. All irreversible.

Humanity had split into temporal and linear populations.

The question wasn't whether that was right. It had already happened.

The question was whether both populations would remember they were human.

Sarah experienced the answer across all futures.

Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.

The probability waves hadn't collapsed yet.

But they would.

Eventually.

Across all moments.

Forever.
