Yuki Tanaka stood in the hydroponics bay and watched her plants finally thrive.

The tomatoes were enormous. Leaves deep green. Fruit abundant. Growing at rates that defied Earth biology.

Because they weren't Earth biology anymore.

The crystalline structures had fully integrated with the plant cells. The Martian and terrestrial biology had merged. Created something new. Something that processed carbon dioxide more efficiently than anything Earth had evolved. That pulled nutrients from regolith that should have been barren. That thrived in conditions that would have killed conventional crops.

Yuki touched a tomato. It was warm. Warmer than ambient temperature. The plant was generating its own heat through processes she didn't fully understand yet.

"How are they?" Commander Rivera entered the bay. The commander's skin had a faint blue tint now. The crystalline integration spreading through everyone who'd accepted the transformation. "Safe to eat?"

"I don't know yet. Chemical analysis shows unusual compounds. Probably safe for transformed humans. Possibly toxic for baseline." Yuki ran another scan. "But they're producing oxygen at triple the rate of conventional hydroponics. And they're reproducing. Seeds that grow into hybrid plants. We can scale this up. Feed the colony indefinitely."

"At the cost of our humanity."

"At the cost of our original biology," Yuki corrected. "Humanity is more than DNA. It's culture. Language. Art. Love. All the things we keep even when our cells change." She picked the tomato carefully. "Commander, we're not losing ourselves. We're adapting. Becoming something that can survive here long-term."

Rivera looked at the bay. At the transformed plants. At Yuki's own hands, traced with blue veins. "The people who refused transformation—they're dying. Slowly. The atmospheric contamination is too widespread now. Everyone breathes it. Everyone gets exposed. But only the transformed survive."

"How many holdouts are left?"

"Twenty-three. They've sealed themselves in the ships. Using emergency oxygen. They have maybe three weeks before the supplies run out." Rivera's expression was pained. "They're asking for evacuation. Want me to send them back to Earth. Away from the contamination."

"Can you?"

"Technically yes. The transport ships are functional. We could launch them." Rivera pulled up the logistics. "But the journey takes six months. And the transformed crew members can't pilot for that long in sealed environments. They need Martian atmosphere now. Earth air makes them sick."

Yuki understood the problem. "So you need baseline human pilots. Who are the same people asking for evacuation."

"Exactly. They want to escape. But they're the only ones who can operate the ships. They'd have to choose—stay in the sealed ships and slowly suffocate, or accept transformation and lose their chance to leave."

"That's not a choice. That's coercion."

"I know." Rivera sat heavily on a workbench. "Yuki, I'm running out of options. I can order them to stay. Use military authority to force their participation. But that makes me a tyrant. Or I can let them leave in ships piloted by transformed crew who might not survive the journey. But that makes me a murderer."

Yuki looked at her plants. At the hybrid life that had emerged from catastrophe. "There's a third option."

"Which is?"

"Let them choose. Full information. Full consequences. They can leave in ships piloted by transformed crew who volunteer knowing the risks. Or they can stay and eventually transform. Or they can stay and die as baseline humans. Their choice. Their responsibility."

"And if they choose wrong?"

"There is no wrong. Only different kinds of loss." Yuki pulled up her research data. "Commander, I've been studying the transformation. The crystalline structures don't just modify our biology. They connect us. Create a low-level neural network. Shared processing. Distributed consciousness. The transformed colonists aren't just individuals anymore. We're becoming a collective. Like the Martian ecosystem itself."

Rivera went very still. "You're saying we're losing our individuality."

"I'm saying we're gaining connection. It's not telepathy. We're still separate people. But we can sense each other. Share emotional states. Coordinate instinctively. It's like..." Yuki struggled for words. "Like being part of something larger than yourself while still being yourself. Hard to explain to someone who hasn't experienced it."

"Is it voluntary? Can you disconnect if you want?"

"I don't know. The integration seems permanent once it reaches a certain threshold. But I don't want to disconnect. Being connected feels right. Natural. Like finding a part of myself I didn't know was missing."

Rivera looked at her own hands. At the blue traces spreading through her circulatory system. "I can feel it too. The connections forming. Threads linking me to the transformed colonists. To the plants in this bay. To Mars itself." She met Yuki's eyes. "Should I be frightened?"

"Yes. And fascinated. And hopeful." Yuki smiled. "Commander, we're becoming the first truly Martian humans. Adapted not just to survive here, but to thrive. To integrate with the planet instead of conquering it. That's terrifying. But it's also beautiful."

Rivera stood. "Present your research at tonight's colony meeting. Everyone needs to understand what transformation really means. Then we vote—who stays, who goes, who transforms voluntarily, who waits to see what happens."

"And if the vote fractures the colony?"

"Then we were already fractured. The vote just makes it visible." Rivera moved toward the door. "Yuki, be honest with them. The good and the bad. The losses and the gains. People deserve truth before they decide their future."

Yuki nodded. After Rivera left, she harvested samples from the hybrid plants. Prepared slides showing the cellular integration. Drafted her presentation with careful precision.

She would tell them everything. The biological transformation. The neural networking. The gradual loss of compatibility with Earth ecosystems. The integration with Martian consciousness that made going back impossible.

And she would tell them the parts she couldn't put in scientific terms. The sense of belonging. The rightness of breathing Martian air and feeling it nourish her in ways Earth atmosphere never had. The knowledge that she was part of something ancient and patient and vast.

The transformed colonists weren't invaders anymore. They were immigrants. Becoming native to their new world one cell at a time.

That night, Yuki stood before the assembled colony and showed them what they were becoming.

Some people cried. Some people left immediately, heading for the sealed ships. Some people asked questions she couldn't answer.

But some people—most people—looked at the data and saw what she saw. Not loss. Not corruption. Not the end of humanity.

Evolution. Adaptation. The next step in a journey that had started when the first human looked at the stars and wondered what was out there.

The vote was close. But when the numbers came in, sixty-eight percent chose to stay. To transform. To become Martian.

The remaining thirty-two percent boarded the ships. A few baseline pilots volunteered to fly them, knowing the journey would probably trigger their own transformation before reaching Earth.

Yuki watched the ships launch from the hydroponics bay. Watched them burn away from Mars, carrying the last baseline humans away from a world that had claimed the rest.

She felt sad. But also relieved. The colony had chosen its path. Chosen adaptation over purity. Future over past.

Mars had offered them a gift. Strange. Terrifying. Irreversible.

But a gift nonetheless.

And they'd accepted it.

She turned back to her plants. They were growing. Thriving. Producing food that would sustain a colony of hybrid humans who breathed Martian air and dreamed Martian dreams.

The tomato in her hand was ripe. Perfect. Alien and familiar simultaneously.

Yuki bit into it. The taste was different. Richer. Complex in ways Earth tomatoes never achieved.

It tasted like home.

Her new home.

The one she'd grow into, one transformed cell at a time.
