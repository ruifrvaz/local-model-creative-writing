The transmission from Earth arrived during breakfast. Rivera read it twice, then called an emergency meeting.

Alexis arrived to find the commander's face carefully neutral. Never a good sign.

"Earth has responded to our discovery reports," Rivera said once everyone assembled. "They're sending a scientific team. Arrival in four months."

"That's good news," Hassan said.

"It would be, except for the rest of the message." Rivera pulled up the text. "Corporate is suspending all construction and expansion activities until the scientific team completes their assessment."

Silence. Then Alexis spoke. "We can't survive four months without expanding production."

"Corporate believes we can."

"Corporate is wrong." Alexis pulled up the resource projections. "Look at these numbers. We're already in deficit. Without expanded power and water production, we'll be on emergency rationing in six weeks."

Rivera nodded. "I'm aware. I've sent three follow-up messages explaining the situation. They're insistent. No construction near the subsurface structures until Earth's team arrives."

"Then we build somewhere else," Chen said.

"Where? Every viable site is within five hundred meters of the structure network. Hassan's mapping shows it extends under most of the colony."

Hassan looked uncomfortable. "I didn't realize the scope when I started the survey. The subsurface network is massive. Kilometers of tunnels and chambers. It's an entire city down there."

"An empty city," Yuki pointed out. "The builders are long dead. There's no one to disturb."

"We don't know that for certain." Rivera met each person's eyes. "And corporate isn't willing to risk it. Not when the structures might contain technology or knowledge worth more than the colony."

Alexis felt cold understanding settle over her. "This isn't about protecting alien artifacts. It's about ownership."

"Corporate wants exclusive access to whatever's down there," Rivera confirmed. "They're willing to sacrifice the colony to maintain that control."

"That's insane," Chen said.

"That's business." Rivera closed the transmission. "But it doesn't change our reality. We have orders. How we respond to those orders is up to us."

"You're asking if we should disobey," Hassan said quietly.

"I'm asking what you think our priorities should be. The colony's survival or corporate's directives."

Alexis looked around the table. Chen looked angry. Yuki looked scared. Hassan looked conflicted.

All of them looked tired.

"We didn't come to Mars to follow orders," Alexis said. "We came to build something permanent. Something that lasts. We can't do that if we're dead."

"Agreed," Chen said immediately.

Yuki nodded slowly. "I didn't sign up to abandon people for corporate profits."

Hassan was quiet longer. Finally: "The structures are important. They deserve proper study. But not at the cost of human lives."

Rivera straightened. "Then we're in agreement. We proceed with construction. Carefully. With protocols to preserve the subsurface structures where possible. But we don't let people die waiting for Earth's approval."

"Corporate will remove you," Alexis said. "Probably all of us."

"Let them try. It'll take four months for their replacement team to arrive. By then, we'll have either solved the resource crisis or died trying." Rivera pulled up the construction plans. "Kwan, you're approved to begin the remote solar array. Chen, start the habitat expansion—phased approach as planned. Yuki, increase hydroponics production however you can. Hassan, keep mapping, but stay available for consultation on construction sites."

Orders given, Rivera dismissed them. Alexis lingered.

"Commander, they'll crucify you for this."

"Probably." Rivera didn't look concerned. "But I'll be crucified with a living crew. I can accept that."

"What if we're wrong? What if the structures are more important than we realize?"

"Then Earth's scientific team will study them in four months. Along with a functioning colony that survived because we made hard choices." Rivera met her eyes. "I'm not gambling with people's lives for corporate politics, Alexis. Not now. Not ever."

Alexis left feeling both relieved and terrified. They were committing mutiny. Gentle, necessary mutiny, but mutiny nonetheless.

She found Chen in the engineering bay, already pulling equipment specs for the expansion.

"We're really doing this," he said.

"Looks like it."

"Good." Chen didn't sound conflicted. "I'm tired of watching people on Earth make decisions that kill people on Mars."

They worked through the day, planning construction that would save lives and end careers. By evening, Alexis had detailed specifications for the solar array, complete with protocols to avoid damaging the subsurface structures.

She could build it in three weeks. Maybe two if they worked around the clock.

The panel fabrication unit hummed to life. Raw materials fed through, transformed into photovoltaic cells that would drink Martian sunlight and convert it to electricity.

Power. Life. Survival.

Worth any career. Worth any consequence.

Alexis watched the first panels emerge and felt satisfaction settle in her chest. This was right. This was what they'd come to Mars to do.

Not to follow corporate directives or wait for Earth's approval.

To build. To survive. To make humanity's presence on Mars permanent.

Even if it cost them everything.

Rivera made an announcement at dinner. Calm. Professional. Explaining the decision to proceed with construction despite corporate orders.

The crew responded with quiet approval. No one cheered. No one celebrated. They just nodded and went back to eating.

Because everyone knew the math. Survival required resources. Resources required construction. Construction meant defying orders.

Simple as that.

After dinner, Alexis stood at the viewport and watched the sun set over Martian landscape. The sky faded from pink to deep purple, stars emerging one by one.

Somewhere out there, Earth spun in its comfortable orbit. People lived their lives never thinking about oxygen levels or water recycling or subsurface alien cities.

Alexis didn't envy them. This was where she wanted to be. Doing impossible things. Making hard choices. Building something that mattered.

Even if corporate fired her. Even if Earth called them mutineers.

Mars was home now. And home was worth fighting for.

She returned to the engineering bay and began the first construction sequence.

The solar panels would rise in the Martian soil. The colony would survive.

And four months from now, when Earth's team arrived, they'd find a thriving settlement built on defiance and determination.

Or they'd find graves. Honest graves of people who chose survival over submission.

Either way, they chose. They acted. They refused to die quietly.

That was enough. It had to be enough.

Alexis initiated the fabrication sequence and watched the machines come to life.

Mars wouldn't kill them. Not today.

Tomorrow was someone else's problem.
