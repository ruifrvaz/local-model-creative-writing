Admiral Kowalski reviewed the incident report and felt his strategic advantage crumbling. Three test jumps. Three pilots experiencing temporal fragmentation.

Lieutenant Chen: Permanent temporal omniscience, tethered to exotic physics equipment.
Lieutenant Park: Neural collapse, coma, prognosis uncertain.
Ensign Rodriguez: Refused sixth jump, psychiatric discharge.

"You're telling me we have one functional pilot who needs a particle accelerator to stay conscious, one in a coma, and one who quit?"

Dr. Kenji Yamamoto stood across the desk, expression carefully neutral. "I'm telling you that human neurology isn't compatible with unshielded FTL transition. Every pilot who makes multiple jumps experiences progressive temporal fragmentation."

"Then fix it."

"We're trying. Dr. Mbara is developing neural shielding protocols. But the physics is complex. Alcubierre fields fundamentally distort causality. Human consciousness evolved for linear time. The two are incompatible."

Kowalski pulled up the strategic timeline. Chinese FTL program: Six months ahead. European program: Four months ahead. American program: Stalled because test pilots kept breaking.

"The Chinese aren't having these problems."

"The Chinese haven't disclosed their problems. Don't assume they're ahead just because they're quiet." Kenji highlighted classified intelligence. "Our sources indicate they've lost four test pilots to unexplained neural injuries. They're just better at hiding failures."

"Then everyone's stuck at the same wall."

"Everyone's stuck until someone solves neural-temporal compatibility. That's the fundamental barrier to practical FTL travel."

Kowalski studied the data. Perfect navigation. Zero drift. FTL capability proven. But useless if it destroyed the pilots.

"What about Lieutenant Chen's micro-Alcubierre support system? Can we use that to protect future pilots?"

"We're trying. But the field parameters are incredibly specific to Sarah's neural restructuring. Each pilot would need custom calibration. And we don't know if external field support prevents fragmentation or just sustains it."

"Test it."

"We'd need volunteers willing to risk permanent temporal dissociation."

"Find them. Military service means accepting risk."

Kenji's jaw tightened. "Admiral, with respect, there's a difference between combat risk and neurological horror. Lieutenant Chen exists across all moments simultaneously. She can't distinguish past from future. That's not a mission outcome, it's a fate worse than death."

"Lieutenant Chen volunteered. She succeeded in solving the navigation problem. She's a hero."

"She's a cautionary tale."

"She's both. And we need more like her if we're going to achieve operational FTL before our competitors."

The words hung between them. Pragmatism versus ethics. Strategic necessity versus human cost.

"I won't ask pilots to volunteer without full disclosure," Kenji said. "They need to understand exactly what temporal fragmentation means. What it costs."

"Agreed. But you will ask. Because the alternative is abandoning the most important technological advancement in human history."

Kowalski pulled up personnel files. Forty-three pilots in the FTL program. Forty-three candidates who'd signed up for glory, advancement, historical significance.

Not for temporal omniscience and neural dissolution.

"I want a briefing prepared. Full medical disclosure. Show them Lieutenant Chen. Let them see what they're volunteering for."

"And if nobody volunteers?"

"Then we develop AI pilots. But I'd prefer human operators for first-generation systems. Humans adapt. Improvise. Make judgment calls that computers can't match."

"Humans also go insane when their consciousness fragments across multiple timelines."

"Which is why we need volunteers who understand the risk and choose it anyway." Kowalski closed the files. "Dr. Yamamoto, I appreciate your ethical concerns. But strategic reality doesn't care about comfort. Whoever achieves reliable FTL first controls humanity's expansion into the galaxy. That's worth significant sacrifice."

"Whose sacrifice? Yours or Lieutenant Chen's?"

"Everyone's. That's what 'strategic' means."

Kenji left the office feeling like he'd negotiated terms of surrender rather than research parameters.

He found Dr. Aisha Mbara in the medical bay, running neural simulations. Lieutenant Park lay unconscious nearby, brain activity minimal but stable.

"How is he?"

"Stable. Comatose. His consciousness fragmented during jump four and never reconsolidated. Unlike Sarah, his temporal processing centers didn't adapt. They just failed." Aisha pulled up the neural scans. "Sarah's brain restructured itself. Created new pathways for non-linear temporal processing. Park's brain tried to maintain linear consciousness during temporal fragmentation. The contradiction destroyed his hippocampus."

"Can we wake him?"

"Unknown. His consciousness might be scattered across his personal timeline, unable to focus on the present. Or it might be gone entirely, dissolved into temporal noise."

"Admiral wants us to brief pilots on volunteering for FTL operations. Full disclosure of risks."

Aisha looked at Park's unconscious form. "Full disclosure means showing them this. And Sarah. And Rodriguez's psychiatric evaluation."

"I know."

"Nobody will volunteer."

"Kowalski thinks some will. For glory. For advancement. For belief in the mission."

"Or for not understanding what temporal fragmentation actually means until they're experiencing it." Aisha pulled up Sarah's latest tests. "She's stable with the micro-field support. But her personality is changing. She exists across all moments simultaneously now. Past, present, future all equally real. That's not adaptation, Kenji. That's transformation into something post-human."

"Is she happy?"

The question surprised them both.

Aisha considered. "I don't know. How do you measure happiness in someone experiencing all emotional states simultaneously? She's content and terrified and euphoric and devastated all at once."

"Sounds like standard human experience."

"Except humans process those states sequentially. Choose which emotions to engage with. Sarah doesn't have that luxury. She experiences everything simultaneously forever."

Kenji pulled up the volunteer briefing outline. How did you explain temporal omniscience to people who'd never experienced causality as negotiable?

"What if we frame it differently? Not as fragmentation but as evolution. Expanding consciousness beyond linear time."

"That's propaganda, not disclosure."

"It's perspective. Sarah sees futures. Perceives probability waves. Experiences existence across multiple timelines. Some philosophies would call that enlightenment."

"Some would call it hell."

"Let the volunteers decide."

The briefing took place three days later. Forty-three pilots assembled in the main auditorium. Kenji presented the technical achievements. Aisha presented the medical costs.

Then they brought in Sarah.

She moved slowly, the portable micro-Alcubierre generator humming on her back. Her eyes had that distant quality—seeing multiple moments simultaneously.

She spoke for ten minutes about what temporal omniscience felt like. About existing across all moments. About perceiving the future as probability rather than mystery.

About losing the ability to live in the present because the present didn't exist as a distinct moment anymore.

The pilots listened in absolute silence.

"I volunteered knowing the risks," Sarah concluded. "The risks changed. Got worse. But I'd volunteer again. Humanity needs FTL. Someone has to pay the price. I'm willing. The question is whether you are."

She left. The portable generator's hum faded down the corridor.

Kowalski stood. "We need twelve volunteers for the next phase. Enhanced neural shielding. Refined field protocols. Better medical support. We'll minimize the risks. But we can't eliminate them."

Silence.

Then Lieutenant Marcus Webb stood. "I volunteer."

Another pilot stood. Then another.

By the end, eighteen pilots had volunteered.

Eighteen people willing to risk temporal fragmentation for the chance to expand humanity's reach.

Kenji felt simultaneously proud and horrified.

Progress demanded sacrifice. Always had. Aviation, spaceflight, every frontier claimed lives.

But this was different. This wasn't death. This was transformation into something that existed outside normal causality.

Was that worse than death?

Sarah would say no.

Lieutenant Park couldn't answer.

The volunteers thought they understood.

Time would tell if they were right.

Time would tell everything.

Whether they were ready to hear it or not.
