Ambassador Chen Wu received the assassination threat at 1400 station time.

Not subtle. Not coded. Just a simple message: "Vote yes on the autonomy clause and you die."

She forwarded it to Security Officer Lena Volkov without comment. Threats were part of diplomatic work. Usually empty. Usually.

Lena arrived at Chen's quarters within ten minutes. "This is the third threat this week. Different sources, same message. Someone really doesn't want that clause to pass."

"Someone with the Independent Factions. Or someone pretending to be." Chen pulled up the voting timeline. "The autonomy clause vote is in seventy-two hours. If it passes, Independents get legitimate governance rights. If it fails, they remain under Earth Coalition oversight."

"High stakes," Lena observed.

"High enough to kill for, apparently." Chen studied the threat analysis. "What's your assessment?"

"Credible enough to take seriously. The previous sabotage attempt shows someone's willing to use violence." Lena pulled up station security protocols. "I'm recommending full protection detail. No public appearances without escort."

"That sends the wrong message. Makes me look afraid."

"Being afraid is rational when someone threatens to kill you." Lena's expression was firm. "Ambassador, political theater isn't worth your life."

Chen considered. "Compromise. Discrete security. Enhanced monitoring. But I continue normal diplomatic functions. Fear doesn't win negotiations."

Lena wanted to argue but recognized the futility. Diplomats were as stubborn as security officers, just in different ways.

"I'll assign two officers to your detail. Invisible as I can make them."

The protection detail started immediately. Two security specialists, trained in close protection, armed with non-lethal weapons suitable for station environment.

Chen barely noticed them. They moved like shadows, maintaining distance while covering angles.

The next threat arrived eighteen hours later. This time, more specific.

"Medical bay, tomorrow, 0900. Don't be there."

Chen forwarded it to Lena. "They're telegraphing their move."

"Or luring you away from scheduled events so they can strike elsewhere." Lena pulled up Chen's calendar. "What's at 0900 tomorrow?"

"Private meeting with Independent Faction delegate Kofi Mensah. Discussing the autonomy clause language."

"In your quarters?"

"Conference room seven. Neutral territory."

Lena studied the layout. "That's three corridors from the medical bay. Someone could trigger an incident in medical, draw security response, hit you while we're distracted."

"Or they could just attack the medical bay at 0900 and you're reading too much into this," Chen suggested.

"Can't afford to assume incompetence from people willing to commit murder." Lena pulled up her tactical planning. "I'm positioning teams at both locations. Heavy presence in medical, concealed presence at the conference room."

"Won't that spook Mensah?"

"Would you rather have a spooked delegate or a dead ambassador?"

Chen smiled slightly. "Point taken. Do what you need to do."

The next morning, Lena positioned her teams with careful precision. Obvious presence in the medical bay—armed officers, scanning equipment, full lockdown protocols.

Hidden presence at conference room seven—concealed officers, surveillance systems, emergency response ready.

Chen arrived for her meeting with Mensah at 0855, her protection detail maintaining discrete distance.

Mensah was already there, looking nervous. "Ambassador Chen. Thank you for meeting."

"Of course. We have important matters to discuss."

They settled into the conference room. Diplomatic niceties, preliminary discussion, careful navigation of political complexities.

At 0900 precisely, alarms began blaring in the medical bay.

"Code Red. Chemical contamination detected. Evacuating medical bay."

Lena's comm exploded with reports. Unknown substance in the air filtration. Personnel showing symptoms. Immediate evacuation in progress.

But her hidden cameras at conference room seven showed nothing. Chen and Mensah continued their meeting, unaware of the crisis three corridors away.

"All teams, maintain positions," Lena ordered. "Medical bay handles the contamination. Protection detail stays on the ambassador."

The medical crisis unfolded rapidly. Thirty personnel evacuated. Decontamination protocols activated. Chemical analysis running.

And while security focused on medical bay, a figure appeared in the corridor outside conference room seven.

Maintenance uniform. Tool bag. Moving with casual confidence toward the conference room.

Lena's surveillance caught it immediately. "Stop that maintenance worker. Conference room corridor. Now."

Her concealed officers intercepted the figure before it reached the door. Standard ID check, routine questioning.

The worker produced credentials. Legitimate. Work order for environmental controls. Everything appeared normal.

Except Lena's instincts screamed otherwise.

"Detain for verification," she ordered. "I don't care if the credentials check out. Something's wrong."

The officers complied, politely requesting the worker accompany them for standard security screening.

The worker bolted.

Not toward escape routes. Toward conference room seven.

Lena's officers tackled the figure before it reached the door. The tool bag spilled, revealing not maintenance equipment but a compact explosive device.

Timer set for 0905. Six minutes from detonation.

"Bomb squad to conference room seven. Evacuate the ambassador. Now."

The protection detail burst into the conference room, startling both Chen and Mensah.

"Ambassador, we need to move. Immediate threat."

Chen stood without question. Years of diplomatic training included trusting security during emergencies.

Mensah followed, confused but cooperative.

They evacuated the conference room at 0903. The bomb squad arrived at 0904. Device disabled at 0906, one minute before detonation.

In the holding cell, the would-be bomber sat in silence. No identification beyond the forged credentials. No statement.

But chemical analysis of the medical bay contamination revealed it was harmless. Irritating, theatrical, but not dangerous.

A diversion. Exactly as Lena had suspected.

Chen stood in Lena's office, watching the interrogation feed. "Someone coordinated this. Medical bay distraction, bomber with legitimate-looking credentials, precise timing."

"Professional operation," Lena agreed. "Not random extremists. Organized, funded, trained."

"By whom?"

"That's what I intend to find out." Lena pulled up the forensic analysis. "The bomber won't talk, but evidence doesn't need cooperation."

The investigation took six hours. Chemical trace analysis from the medical bay. Equipment sourcing for the bomb. Digital forensics on the forged credentials.

All the evidence pointed to a single source: Coalition Security Services. Internal intelligence apparatus.

Someone within Earth Coalition's own security organization had tried to assassinate their own ambassador.

"That's impossible," Chen said when Lena presented the findings.

"That's what the evidence shows." Lena displayed the digital trail. "The forged credentials came from Coalition systems. The bomber was trained in Coalition methods. The chemical diversion used Coalition materials."

"Someone's trying to frame Coalition Security."

"Or someone within Coalition Security is trying to kill you and blame it on Independent extremists." Lena met Chen's eyes. "Either way, your own government is compromised."

Chen sat in silence, processing the implications. Political rivals willing to commit murder to prevent the autonomy clause. Internal betrayal at the highest levels.

"What do you recommend?" she asked finally.

"Public disclosure. Make this assassination attempt impossible to cover up. Force Coalition to investigate their own security services."

"That destroys my political capital. Makes me look weak."

"Surviving makes you look strong. Dead ambassadors have no political capital at all." Lena pulled up the evidence files. "We brief Director Nkrumah, then we go public. Full transparency."

Chen considered her options. Political survival versus actual survival. Career advancement versus staying alive.

"Do it," she decided. "Full disclosure. If Coalition Security wants me dead, they can explain why to the entire diplomatic community."

The press conference happened two hours later. Chen, flanked by Lena and Director Nkrumah, presenting the evidence.

The assassination attempt. The Coalition Security connection. The political motivation.

Complete transparency.

The reaction was explosive. Coalition delegates demanding investigations. Independent Faction leaders calling for reforms. Media outlets broadcasting across the system.

And somewhere in Coalition Security headquarters, someone realized their operation had failed catastrophically.

The autonomy clause vote was postponed while investigations proceeded. But the political landscape had shifted fundamentally.

Chen had survived. The truth was public. And whoever had ordered her assassination was now facing scrutiny from every angle.

"Thank you," Chen said to Lena after the press conference. "You saved my life."

"I did my job. Keeping people alive." Lena pulled up the ongoing investigation. "But this isn't over. Someone ordered this hit. Until we identify them, you're still in danger."

"Then we keep investigating. Keep digging. Keep pushing for truth."

"That's the spirit." Lena smiled slightly. "For someone who almost died today, you're remarkably determined."

"Death threats don't scare me. Corruption does." Chen pulled up the diplomatic schedule. "And I have work to do. Negotiations to salvage. Clauses to pass."

"With triple security this time."

"With whatever security you recommend." Chen met her eyes. "I trust you, Officer Volkov. Keep me alive long enough to finish this."

"That's the plan, Ambassador. That's exactly the plan."
