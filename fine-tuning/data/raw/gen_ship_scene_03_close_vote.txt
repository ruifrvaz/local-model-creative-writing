The vote results appeared on every terminal simultaneously.

Continue Mission: 4,203 votes
Settle Kepler-442b: 4,197 votes
Abstain: 1,762 votes

Six votes. The future of humanity decided by six people in a population of ten thousand.

Malik Torres stared at the numbers and felt sick. They'd won. Barely. The mission would continue to Proxima Centauri. But nearly half the ship wanted to abandon it.

And the abstentions—people too torn to choose either way. People waiting to see which side won before committing. People paralyzed by the weight of the decision.

"Captain Reyes requests your presence in the command center," his comm said. "Immediately."

Malik made his way through corridors that felt different somehow. Tense. Like the ship itself was holding its breath.

The command center was packed. Department heads. Council members. Engineers. Medical personnel. Everyone who made the Endeavor function.

Captain Reyes stood at the center console, her expression carefully neutral.

"The vote has concluded," she said. "We continue to Proxima Centauri. But there's a problem."

"Just one?" Someone laughed bitterly.

Reyes ignored it. "The people who voted to settle Kepler-442b are refusing to accept the result. They're demanding a recount. Claiming vote tampering. Alleging the ship's computer—which is our most impartial arbiter—was compromised."

"That's insane," Malik said. "The voting system is triple-audited. Unhackable."

"They don't care about facts. They care about losing." Reyes pulled up protest footage. Crowds gathering in the main auditorium. Angry voices. Signs demanding justice. "Four thousand people just learned they're going to die chasing a dream they don't share. They're not going to accept that quietly."

"What do they want?"

"A second vote. Or implementation of the separation plan. Or revolution. Depends which faction you ask." Reyes looked exhausted. "We have protests in six different modules. Work stoppages in critical departments. Threats of sabotage. The ship is fracturing."

Malik pulled up the separation plan he'd proposed. Two ships. Two destinations. Both populations with a chance at survival.

"Offer it again," he said. "The separation. Let people choose which mission they support. Split the Endeavor. Both groups get what they want."

"The vote rejected separation. Fifty-seven percent wanted to stay unified." Reyes gestured at the protesters. "Those people don't care about previous votes. They want what they want. And they're willing to tear the ship apart to get it."

"Then let them have it. Controlled separation is better than civil war."

"Separation halves our genetic diversity. Makes the degradation crisis worse for both groups. Dr. Okoye estimates genetic collapse in thirty years instead of fifty. For both ships." Reyes met his eyes. "We'd be choosing slow extinction over long-term survival. That's not leadership. That's surrender."

"And forcing half the population to continue a mission they oppose is tyranny," Malik countered. "Captain, we can't make this work through force. People have to believe in the mission. Choose it voluntarily. Otherwise we're just a very slow prison."

Eva Sato stood. The historian looked stricken. "If we separate, we abandon two hundred years of unity. Everything our ancestors built. The shared purpose that sustained us."

"That purpose is already gone," someone else said. "We're just arguing over its corpse."

The command center erupted. Shouting. Accusations. Years of tension breaking through the surface like a pressure seal failure.

Reyes raised her hand. Waited for silence.

"We take another vote," she said finally. "Not on the mission. On separation. We ask the question clearly—do we stay together as one ship heading to Proxima, or do we split into two ships with different destinations. Simple. Clear. No abstentions allowed. Everyone chooses."

"And if that vote is close too?" Malik asked.

"Then we implement whatever wins. Even if it's by one vote. Because democracy means accepting outcomes you don't like. That's the price of self-governance." Reyes pulled up the ballot interface. "Forty-eight hours. Same as before. But this time, everyone votes or everyone suffers the consequences of non-participation."

The meeting adjourned. Malik returned to his quarters and found a message waiting. From his mother. One of the original colonists. Born on Earth. One of the few first-generation survivors still living.

He opened it.

"Malik, I hear the ship is tearing itself apart. I want you to know something. Your grandmother and I didn't leave Earth because we believed in Proxima Centauri. We left because Earth was dying. We believed in somewhere else. Anywhere else. The specific destination mattered less than the journey."

She paused. The recording was old. Shaky. Her face lined with age and the weight of knowing she'd die in transit.

"The mission isn't about Proxima. It's about refusing to give up. About choosing hope even when the universe offers none. If the ship separates, if people choose Kepler over Proxima, that's fine. They're still choosing hope. Still refusing to quit. That's what matters. Not the destination. The determination to keep moving forward when everything says to stop."

The message ended. Malik sat in the dark, processing his mother's words.

She was right. The mission wasn't about coordinates. It was about survival. About humanity refusing to accept extinction.

Whether they reached Proxima or Kepler or scattered across a dozen different worlds didn't matter. What mattered was the refusal to stop trying.

He pulled up the separation plan one more time. Studied the logistics. The resource allocation. The demographic distribution that would give both ships the best chance.

Then he started writing. A proposal. Comprehensive. Detailed. Showing exactly how separation could work. What each ship would have. What each population would sacrifice and gain.

By morning, he'd finished. He sent it to Captain Reyes. To the council. To the engineering teams. To everyone who needed to understand that separation wasn't surrender.

It was adaptation. Another kind of hope.

The second vote was scheduled. The ship held its breath. And Malik wondered if his mother would approve of what he'd done.

Probably. She'd always taught him that survival required flexibility. That the universe didn't care about your plans. That the people who survived were the ones who could pivot when circumstances changed.

The Endeavor was pivoting. Whether as one ship or two remained to be seen.

But they were still moving forward.

Still refusing to quit.

And in the hostile universe where humanity was a statistical improbability, that stubbornness might be their greatest asset.

Malik hoped so.

Because hope was all they had left.
