Dr. Kenji Yamamoto stared at the temporal gradient equations and felt the universe resist understanding. Sarah's data was perfect. Too perfect.

"These numbers shouldn't be possible," Dr. Hassan Patel said. "She's measuring temporal variance at scales below our instrument precision."

"Because she's not using instruments. She's using her restructured neural tissue." Kenji pulled up the sixth jump data. "Every measurement matches theoretical predictions within margins we couldn't achieve with quantum sensors."

"That doesn't mean her perceptions are reliable. Neural plasticity can create convincing hallucinations."

"Hallucinations don't predict navigation drift with ninety-nine percent accuracy."

Dr. Aisha Mbara entered the lab carrying new medical scans. Her expression suggested the news wasn't good.

"Sarah's neural restructuring is accelerating. Her hippocampus is forming structures that don't exist in normal human brains. Temporal processing centers that shouldn't be anatomically possible."

"But they work," Kenji said.

"They work now. What happens in six months? A year? Will she still be Sarah Chen, or something else entirely?"

The question hung unanswered.

Kenji pulled up Sarah's psychological evaluations. Cognitive function normal. Memory intact. Personality consistent. But the temporal perception tests showed results that defied conventional neurology.

She could predict future events with sixty percent accuracy.

Not through precognition. Through perceiving temporal probability waves directly.

"We need to solve the navigation drift before her brain finishes restructuring," Kenji said. "If we lose her perceptual abilities, we lose our best data source."

"If we push too hard, we lose her entirely." Aisha highlighted cellular stress markers. "Her neurons are operating at unsustainable metabolic levels. The temporal processing is burning through resources faster than her body can supply them."

"How long?"

"Unknown. Weeks, maybe. Then her brain starts choosing which functions to sacrifice to maintain temporal perception."

Kenji felt cold. "What functions?"

"Probably executive function first. Decision-making, impulse control, social processing. She'd maintain awareness but lose the ability to act on it coherently."

"That's not acceptable."

"Then solve the navigation problem fast. Before she burns out trying to help you."

Kenji pulled up the temporal gradient models. Sarah's data showed clear patterns. The Alcubierre field collapsed from front to back, creating a rolling wave of temporal emergence that lasted point-zero-zero-three seconds.

During that time, the ship existed in multiple temporal states simultaneously.

The navigation computer couldn't account for this because it assumed instantaneous field collapse. Classical physics meeting quantum reality.

Sarah could perceive it because her brain had adapted to existing across temporal states.

She'd become the sensor they needed.

At the cost of her humanity.

"What if we reverse the collapse sequence?" Kenji asked. "Instead of front-to-back, collapse the field uniformly from all directions?"

Hassan pulled up the simulations. "Uniform collapse requires synchronized field termination across all generators. We'd need quantum-entangled timing with femtosecond precision."

"Build it."

"The complexity—"

"I don't care. We have weeks before Sarah's brain cannibalizes itself. Either we solve this or we lose her and the entire project." Kenji highlighted the critical systems. "Uniform field collapse eliminates temporal gradients. No gradient means no drift."

"In theory."

"Sarah's data proves the theory. Now we engineer the practice."

The lab shifted into focused urgency. Hassan designed synchronized termination systems. Dr. Lisa Zhang modeled quantum entanglement networks. Kenji coordinated integration.

Three days later, they had a prototype.

Sarah arrived for jump seven looking thinner. Her eyes had a distant quality, like she was watching events from multiple timeframes simultaneously.

"How are you feeling?" Aisha asked.

"Like I'm burning from the inside out. But I can see the solution now. The field needs to collapse spherically, not linearly. Kenji's on the right track."

"Your cellular metabolism is critical. One more jump might push you past recovery."

Sarah smiled. It wasn't entirely human anymore. "Then let's make it count."

The jump ship launched with the new termination system installed. Kenji monitored from mission control, feeling the weight of Sarah's life measured in equations.

"Field generators online. Synchronized termination network active. Quantum entanglement verified across all nodes."

Sarah's voice came through clear. "I can feel it. The system wants to collapse uniformly. It's fighting the natural front-to-back gradient."

"Can you help guide it?"

"I can try. My temporal perception might interface with the field directly."

"Sarah, that's not—"

"Jump initiating. Thirty seconds."

Kenji watched the countdown and prayed to physics that didn't care about prayers.

The jump began.

Sarah's neural sensors showed immediate anomalies. Her brain was engaging with the Alcubierre field directly, using temporal perception to influence field geometry.

"She's modulating the bubble," Hassan said, stunned. "Neural feedback is affecting spacetime curvature."

"That's impossible."

"Tell her that."

The field held stable for three seconds. Then collapse—uniform, spherical, exactly as designed.

The ship emerged at target coordinates.

Zero drift.

Perfect navigation.

But Sarah's neural activity was flatline.

"Medical emergency!" Aisha was already running. "Get her to neural intensive care. Now!"

The ship docked. They rushed Sarah to the medical bay. Her body was alive but her consciousness was gone.

No. Not gone.

Scattered.

Her neural activity showed patterns across multiple temporal states. She was conscious. Just not in any single moment.

She existed everywhere in time simultaneously.

Perfectly aware. Completely unable to focus on the present.

Aisha worked for six hours trying to consolidate her temporal states. Nothing worked. Sarah's consciousness had fragmented across the timeline, experiencing all moments equally.

Kenji stood in the medical bay and watched the woman who'd solved faster-than-light navigation trapped in temporal superposition.

"Can we bring her back?"

"I don't know. She's not unconscious. She's omniscious—experiencing every moment of her existence simultaneously. Past, present, future, all equally real."

"That sounds like hell."

"Or enlightenment. Depends on perspective."

Admiral Kowalski arrived, looking at the navigation data. "Perfect jump. Zero drift. We can replicate this?"

"Yes," Kenji said. "Using Sarah's technique of neural-temporal interface. But it costs consciousness fragmentation."

"Unacceptable for human pilots. Can we automate it?"

The question felt obscene with Sarah lying three meters away, lost in time.

"Theoretically. But it would require AI systems capable of temporal perception. We'd need to give computers the ability Sarah developed."

"Do it. I want prototype systems in six months."

Kowalski left. Kenji stared at Sarah's unconscious form.

They'd solved FTL navigation.

Cost: One brilliant pilot's linear experience of time.

Gain: Humanity's access to the stars.

The math was brutal. The ethics were worse.

Aisha pulled up long-term treatment options. "We might be able to gradually consolidate her temporal states. Bring her back to linear consciousness over months or years."

"Will she be the same person?"

"Will any of us after this?"

Kenji returned to the lab. Hassan and Lisa were already designing AI systems with temporal perception capabilities. The project would continue. FTL travel would become reliable.

And Sarah Chen would exist forever in all moments simultaneously.

Aware but unable to act.

Conscious but unable to choose which moment to inhabit.

The perfect observer, trapped in omniscience.

Kenji pulled up the project files and started documentation. Future researchers would need to understand what they'd learned. What it cost.

How to achieve faster-than-light travel without sacrificing human consciousness.

Or whether that sacrifice was inevitable.

The price of breaking causality.

The cost of touching infinity.

Sarah had paid it willingly.

Kenji would make sure her sacrifice meant something.

Even if it meant she'd never experience the future she'd helped create.

Not in linear time, anyway.

She was experiencing it now. And always. And never.

All simultaneously.

The perfect solution to faster-than-light navigation.

And the perfect tragedy.
