Commander Rivera stood in the empty recreation dome, making her final inspection before decompression.

The dome had been the colony's heart. Movie nights. Exercise equipment. Community gatherings. The place where forty-three people remembered they were human instead of just survival machines.

Now it was being sacrificed. Stripped for parts. Decompressed to save power.

"It's the right call," Alexis said beside her.

"Right doesn't make it easy." Rivera pulled up the decompression schedule. "How many modules are we abandoning total?"

"Three. Recreation, workshop secondary, storage bay two. That gives us enough structural materials and reduces our power consumption by eighteen percent."

"And reduces our living space by twenty-five percent."

"We're prioritizing survival over comfort. It's the only option."

Rivera knew she was right. But knowing didn't help. Every abandoned module represented failure. Retreat. Admission that Mars was winning.

She initiated decompression. Airlocks sealed. Pumps engaged. Atmosphere vented back to the main habitat.

The dome went silent. Dead. Just another piece of abandoned infrastructure on a planet littered with human attempts.

"Let's get to work," Rivera said.

The salvage operation took three weeks. Chen and his team carefully removed structural supports. Power conduits. Atmospheric recyclers. Everything that could be repurposed.

They reinforced the main habitat. Doubled up critical systems. Created redundancy where none existed before.

The colony shrank. Became denser. More cramped. But theoretically more stable.

Theoretically.

"We're out of easy solutions," Alexis reported. "The next crisis, we don't have anything left to sacrifice."

"Then we pray there isn't a next crisis."

"On Mars? We're guaranteed a next crisis. Only question is when and what kind."

Rivera pulled up the evacuation request she'd drafted weeks ago. Still unsent. Still waiting for conditions to deteriorate enough to justify abandonment.

How bad did things have to get before she admitted defeat?

The message from Earth arrived during the night shift. Olympus Resource Corporation. Official communication.

*Commander Rivera: Your mining quota remains unfulfilled. We are terminating the independent operation contract effective immediately. Olympus personnel will arrive in ninety days to assume colony management.*

Rivera read it three times. The words didn't improve.

They were being bought out. Replaced. Absorbed into corporate operations.

She called an emergency assembly. All senior staff. No time for politeness.

"Olympus is taking over. Three months from now, we're corporate employees or we're unemployed."

The room erupted. Anger. Disbelief. Protests.

"They can't just take our colony!" Yuki said.

"They can. Contract allows termination for quota non-fulfillment. We didn't meet their targets."

"Because we were busy surviving! Fighting crises! Keeping people alive!"

"Olympus doesn't care about our excuses. They care about profits. We're not profitable, so we're being replaced."

Alexis stood. "What if we refuse? Tell them we're staying independent?"

"Then they sue. Claim breach of contract. Seize our assets. Blacklist us from future mining operations." Rivera pulled up the contract terms. "We signed away our leverage when we accepted their backing."

"So we give up? Let corporations own Mars?"

"We accept reality. Corporations already own Mars. We were just renting permission to be here."

The meeting devolved into arguments. Proposals. Desperate schemes to avoid the inevitable.

Rivera let them vent. Understood the anger. Shared it.

But she also understood power. Olympus had it. The colony didn't. Simple math.

Later, alone in her quarters, Rivera drafted two messages.

The first to Olympus. Professional. Acknowledging the termination. Requesting details on transition procedures.

The second to Fleet Command. Personal. Requesting asylum for any crew who didn't want to work for Olympus.

She sent both and sat in darkness.

Forty-three people. Eight months of constant crisis. Every system stressed. Every solution temporary. Every victory pyrrhic.

And now, corporate takeover erasing what little independence they'd maintained.

Rivera had led ships before. Commanded crews in hostile environments. Made hard calls under pressure.

But this was different. This was admitting that determination wasn't enough. That willpower couldn't overcome economic reality.

Mars wasn't just a hostile environment. It was an expensive environment. And only corporations had resources to sustain operations here.

Independents could survive for a while. Improvise. Adapt. Fight.

But eventually, the money ran out. The supplies depleted. The crises accumulated faster than solutions.

And corporations moved in. Picking up the pieces. Absorbing the infrastructure. Reaping profits from foundations independents had built.

Rivera pulled up the colony's history. Eight months of detailed logs. Every crisis. Every solution. Every moment of triumph and despair.

Future crews would read this. Learn from it. Maybe avoid some mistakes.

Or maybe just confirm that Mars settlement required corporate resources. That independence was a luxury nobody could afford.

She added her final entry:

*Day 247: Olympus takeover confirmed. Independent operations terminated. Transition begins in ninety days. We survived Mars. But we couldn't survive economics.*

*Lesson learned: Technical problems have technical solutions. Financial problems have only financial solutions. And independents don't have enough money to overcome both.*

*Mars remains unconquered. Just under new management.*

She closed the log and tried to sleep. Tomorrow would bring new challenges. New compromises. New ways to survive in a system that rewarded capital over courage.

The colony would continue. Under corporate control. With corporate resources. Probably more successfully than they'd managed independently.

But something would be lost. The experiment. The dream. The possibility that humans could settle planets without submitting to corporate ownership.

Rivera mourned that loss. Even as she accepted its inevitability.

Some battles were won with determination. Others with resources.

They'd tried determination. Mars had other requirements.

Now came the hard part: explaining to forty-three people that their independence had been temporary all along.

That survival meant submission. That Mars belonged to whoever could afford it.

Not to those who dared it.
