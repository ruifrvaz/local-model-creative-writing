Engineer Malik Torres stood in the observation dome and looked at the planet that wasn't supposed to be there.

Two hundred years into a four-hundred-year voyage, and they'd discovered a world. Not their target—that was still two centuries away. But a marginally habitable planet in a system that scans had missed two hundred years ago.

Or maybe scans hadn't missed it. Maybe the mission planners had known and not told them.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Dr. Eva Sato appeared beside him. The ship's historian, keeper of Earth's cultural memory. Protector of a mission Malik wasn't sure he believed in anymore.

"It's a rock with an atmosphere," Malik said.

"It's a chance. Fresh start. Real gravity. Sky that isn't a painted dome."

"It's not the mission."

"The mission was designed by people two hundred years dead. People who didn't know this planet existed."

Malik turned away from the viewport. They'd had this argument a dozen times in the past month since the discovery. Eva wanted to debate it. Malik wanted to make a decision.

"Captain Reyes called a council meeting," he said. "One hour. Make your case there."

Eva's expression hardened. "I will. And Malik? You should think about what you're asking three thousand people to do. Another two hundred years in a metal can because our great-great-grandparents made a plan."

She left. Malik stayed, watching the planet rotate below. Oxygen atmosphere. Liquid water. Surface temperature ranging from tolerable to brutal. Not ideal. But habitable.

The generation ship Perseverance had been traveling for two centuries. Born in the ship, Malik had never seen Earth. Never walked on a planet. Everything he knew was corridors and recycled air and the constant hum of the fusion drive.

The planet represented something he'd never had: a home that wasn't moving.

But it also represented abandoning the mission. Giving up on the carefully selected world that awaited them two hundred years ahead. The world Earth's best scientists had chosen as humanity's best chance.

Malik made his way to the council chamber. Captain Ana Reyes sat at the head of the table, third-generation captain of a ship that would never complete its journey in her lifetime. Around her: the ship's section leaders, department heads, the people who made decisions that affected three thousand lives.

Medical Director James Okoye spoke first. "I'll be direct. Our genetic diversity is borderline critical. Two hundred years of controlled breeding hasn't prevented drift. We're seeing increased rates of genetic disorders. Another two hundred years, and we might not be viable."

"Might," Eva said. "Not certain."

"Medicine deals in probabilities, not certainties. The probability of genetic collapse increases with every generation."

Eva pulled up her counter-data. "Earth sent us with genetic engineering capability. Embryo banks. The tools to maintain diversity."

"Which require resources we're depleting faster than planned." Okoye's voice was flat. "The ship wasn't designed for four hundred years. It was designed for three fifty, with margins. We're past those margins."

"So we're saying our ancestors lied to us," someone said. Council Member Park, representing the engineering section. "Told us four hundred years, but actually gave us three fifty?"

"They gave us best estimates," Captain Reyes said. "Estimates that didn't account for reality. Maintenance costs. Equipment degradation. The fact that entropy doesn't care about mission schedules."

Malik pulled up the ship's systems status. Every major system showed wear beyond projected levels. Life support operating at ninety-two percent efficiency. Fusion reactor output declining. Genetic banks depleting faster than replenishment rates.

"The planet," Eva said. "Show them the planetary surveys."

The main screen filled with data. Atmosphere: seventy-four percent nitrogen, twenty-one percent oxygen, trace gases within tolerable ranges. Surface water: abundant. Temperature range: minus-forty to plus-fifty Celsius depending on latitude. Gravity: one-point-one G.

"It's not perfect," Eva continued. "But it's habitable. We could survive there. Build a colony. Actually walk under a sky."

"It's not the mission," Malik said.

"The mission is survival. Ensuring humanity's continuation. We can do that here, now, instead of gambling on another two hundred years."

"The mission is reaching Kepler-442b. A world we know is suitable. That Earth's best scientists selected after decades of analysis."

"Earth's scientists are dust," Park said. "We're the ones who have to live with these decisions."

Captain Reyes raised a hand for silence. "I want arguments, not rhetoric. Medical Director, what's your professional assessment of completing the full voyage?"

Okoye pulled up his projections. "Fifty-fifty. We might make it with acceptable genetic diversity. We might arrive with a population too inbred to sustain itself."

"And settling the planet below?"

"Better odds. Fresh environment might introduce selection pressures that improve genetic health. But we'd be starting from scratch. No established infrastructure. High mortality in the first generation."

"Engineering assessment," Reyes said, looking at Malik.

Malik chose his words carefully. "The ship can complete the voyage if we implement strict resource conservation. Reduce non-essential functions. Possibly reduce population through controlled reproduction limits."

"You're talking about eugenics," Eva said.

"I'm talking about survival math. We have finite resources for a finite timeline."

"The planet gives us infinite timeline."

"The planet gives us unknown variables. Unknown diseases. Unknown environmental hazards. Unknown long-term habitability." Malik pulled up the risk assessment he'd been running for weeks. "We know the ship. We know the mission. The planet is a gamble."

"So is another two hundred years," Park said.

The council fragmented into debate. Those born on the ship against those who'd read too much Earth history and romanticized planets. Engineers who trusted known systems against optimists who wanted sky overhead.

Captain Reyes let it run for thirty minutes. Then: "Vote. Do we maintain course for Kepler-442b, or do we settle the planet below?"

The vote was closer than Malik expected. Eighteen for continuing. Fifteen for settling. Three abstentions.

"We continue," Reyes said. "But we implement resource conservation measures immediately. And we establish a contingency plan for the planet below. If things deteriorate beyond acceptable parameters, we have the option to return."

"Return?" Eva's voice was sharp. "You're condemning three thousand people to two more centuries, but keeping a backup plan for a planet we're abandoning?"

"I'm making the decision I was trained to make. Honor the mission. But adapt to reality."

The council adjourned. Malik found Eva in the corridor afterward.

"I'm sorry," he said.

"Are you? Or are you just following programming?" Eva's expression was bitter. "We're not our ancestors, Malik. We don't owe them our lives."

"We owe them our existence. This ship, this mission—it's the reason we're here."

"And it's the reason we'll die here. In a metal tube between stars, never feeling wind or rain. Never seeing anything but recycled everything."

"Better than dying on an unknown planet."

"You don't know that. You just believe it because it's what you were taught."

Eva walked away. Malik watched her go and wondered if she was right.

He made his way to engineering and pulled up the ship's resource projections. With the conservation measures, they could complete the voyage. Probably.

Two hundred years.

Ten more generations born, lived, and died in corridors. Never seeing a horizon. Never standing on ground that wasn't moving.

Malik thought about the planet below. The one they'd leave behind. The chance they were voting against.

And wondered if following the mission was courage or cowardice.

The ship hummed around him. Two centuries of travel. Two more centuries ahead.

He got back to work. Because that's what you did on a generation ship.

You worked. You planned. You hoped the ancestors who sent you knew what they were doing.

And you tried not to think about all the other choices you might have made.
