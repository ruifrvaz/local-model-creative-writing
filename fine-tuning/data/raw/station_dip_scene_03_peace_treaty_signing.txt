Ambassador Chen Wu watched the peace treaty signature ceremony with cautious relief.

Six months of negotiations. Three sabotage attempts. Countless setbacks.

And finally, agreement.

Coalition and Independents signing a treaty that established boundaries. Resource sharing protocols. Dispute resolution mechanisms.

Not perfect. But functional. And that was enough.

"Never thought I'd see this day," Security Officer Volkov said beside him.

"Neither did I. Honestly thought we'd end in war."

"We almost did. Multiple times."

Chen watched the delegates sign. Professional. Cordial. Almost friendly.

"What changed?" Volkov asked. "Why did they suddenly cooperate?"

"Helios Mining Consortium. Discovering we had a common enemy made cooperation easier than conflict."

"So they united against a third party instead of against each other."

"Classic pattern. Humanity needs enemies to define friends."

Volkov pulled up security reports. "We're detecting increased activity from other corporate interests. Mars Collective. Titan Resources. Belt Mining Federation. They're all watching this treaty with interest."

"Let them watch. Treaty provisions apply to all third parties. No exclusive access. No monopoly claims."

"You think that'll stop them?"

"No. But it'll slow them down. Give us time to establish enforcement mechanisms."

The ceremony concluded. Delegates shook hands. Posed for photos. Made public statements about cooperation and mutual prosperity.

Chen knew it was theater. The real negotiations would continue. In private. With less ceremony and more calculation.

But theater mattered. It established expectations. Created social pressure for compliance.

"What's next?" Volkov asked.

"Verification. Compliance monitoring. Dealing with inevitable violations." Chen pulled up the treaty implementation timeline. "This isn't the end. It's the beginning of a different kind of work."

"Less dramatic. More tedious."

"Exactly. The boring work of maintaining peace is harder than the exciting work of preventing war."

They returned to the security center. The station felt different. Quieter. Less tense.

Like everyone could finally exhale.

Director Nkrumah found them reviewing overnight reports. "Gentlemen, well done. You made this possible."

"We prevented disasters," Chen corrected. "The delegates did the actual work."

"Preventing disasters is ninety percent of diplomacy. The other ten is taking credit."

Volkov smiled. "Which we'll graciously decline."

"Humble and effective. My favorite combination." Nkrumah pulled up station operations data. "We're seeing increased docking requests. Apparently successful peace negotiations attract attention."

"More ships means more security risk," Volkov warned.

"Also more economic activity. More relevance. More justification for our neutral status." Nkrumah highlighted the budget projections. "If this continues, we might actually turn a profit."

"Don't get used to it," Chen said. "Peace is expensive to maintain. We'll spend everything we make on verification and monitoring."

"Cynic."

"Realist. Peace doesn't sustain itself. It requires constant work. Constant attention. Constant resources."

Nkrumah nodded. "Which is why we're expanding station capacity. Adding diplomatic facilities. Building infrastructure for long-term peace operations."

"You're betting the station's future on this treaty holding."

"I'm betting humanity needs neutral ground. Whether this specific treaty holds or gets replaced, the station provides value."

Chen hoped he was right. But history suggested otherwise. Peace treaties failed. Neutral grounds became battlefields. Good intentions collapsed under pressure.

But hoping didn't cost anything. And maybe, just maybe, this time would be different.

"I'm authorizing permanent peace monitoring office," Nkrumah said. "Ambassador Chen, you'll head it. Officer Volkov, you'll provide security oversight."

"I'm a negotiator, not an administrator," Chen protested.

"You're whatever the station needs. Right now, we need someone who understands both diplomacy and the brutal reality underlying it."

Chen accepted. Because refusing meant abandoning work he'd started. Meant letting someone less qualified manage fragile peace.

"When do I start?"

"You already have. The treaty signed an hour ago. Compliance monitoring begins now."

Chen pulled up the verification protocols. Sixty-three specific provisions. Seventeen monitoring requirements. Quarterly compliance reports from all signatories.

A bureaucratic nightmare. Exactly what peace required.

"This is going to be tedious," he said.

"Yes. Gloriously, necessarily tedious." Nkrumah smiled. "Welcome to peacetime, Ambassador. It's less exciting than crisis. But hopefully more sustainable."

Chen returned to his quarters to draft the first compliance report. Dry. Technical. Focused on minutiae like mineral extraction rates and docking fee schedules.

Nothing dramatic. Nothing interesting.

Just the boring, essential work of making sure treaties became reality instead of abandoned promises.

He pulled up the first provision: *Parties agree to respect established mining claims registered before treaty ratification.*

Simple language. Complex implications. Dozens of contested claims. Hundreds of disputes.

All requiring mediation. Documentation. Patient negotiation.

Chen started drafting the verification framework. Knowing it would be challenged. Revised. Argued over.

Knowing that tedious was exactly what peace demanded.

Outside his window, Earth rotated. Eight billion people blissfully unaware that war had been prevented.

That peace had been achieved.

That boring bureaucratic work was all that stood between cooperation and conflict.

Chen had spent his career in dramatic negotiations. Crisis management. High-stakes diplomacy.

Now he'd spend it reading mining reports. Reviewing compliance documents. Settling disputes over docking fees.

It was humbling. Unglamorous. Absolutely vital.

And somehow, that felt right.

Peace wasn't glorious. It was paperwork. Procedure. Persistent attention to details nobody celebrated.

But it beat war. Every time. Without exception.

Chen pulled up the second provision and started drafting verification protocols.

One clause at a time. One report at a time.

Building peace through the most powerful force humanity had:

Determined bureaucracy.

Boring. Essential. Unglamorous.

Exactly what the universe needed.
