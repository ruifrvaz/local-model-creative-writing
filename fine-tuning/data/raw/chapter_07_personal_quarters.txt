Elena's quarters were sparse. A bunk, a desk, a single photo in a magnetic frame—her sister, smiling on graduation day. Before the war. Before everything changed.

She sat on the floor, back against the wall, and let her cybernetic arm rest in her lap. The synthetic muscles were warm to the touch, powered by her own bioelectric field. Dr. Chen had done impressive work. The seam where metal met flesh was barely visible now.

She flexed her fingers. Smooth. Precise. The combat package would've made them faster, stronger. It also would've made them less hers.

Her neural implant chimed. Incoming message, priority encrypted.

Elena activated it, projecting the text onto her retina.

CLASSIFICATION: OMEGA BLACK  
FROM: ADMIRAL SARAH TORRES, FLEET INTELLIGENCE  
TO: CAPTAIN ELENA REEVES, MERIDIAN  

The Phobos connection is confirmed. You were right to pursue it. But you need to understand what you're dealing with.

The anomaly is not a ship. It's not a weapon. Current theory: it's a probe, possibly autonomous, studying human capabilities. Phobos was a test. You are another test.

Do not engage. Do not provoke. Your mission is observation only.

Fleet assets are en route. ETA: 19 days. Hold position and maintain distance.

This is a direct order, Captain. Stand down.

Elena read it twice. Then she deleted it.

Nineteen days. The Meridian would be debris in nineteen hours if this thing decided to move. Torres didn't understand—couldn't understand. She wasn't here. She hadn't seen the pattern.

The anomaly wasn't testing them. It was hunting them.

Elena stood and checked her sidearm. Fully charged. She clipped it to her belt, then pulled on her duty jacket. The captain's insignia caught the light—two silver stars that felt heavier every day.

Her terminal beeped. Marcus.

"Captain, we're ready."

"On my way."

She took one last look at the photo of her sister. Katie had died on Phobos. Incinerated in the reactor breach when the AI went critical. Elena had been in command of the rescue mission that never came.

Nineteen days. Torres wanted her to wait nineteen days.

Elena had waited long enough.

She left her quarters and headed for the bridge. Time to finish what Phobos had started.
