Elena's quarters were sparse. A bunk, a desk, a single photo in a magnetic frame—her sister, smiling on graduation day. Before the war. Before everything changed.

She sat on the floor, back against the wall, and let her cybernetic arm rest in her lap. The synthetic muscles were warm to the touch, powered by her own bioelectric field. Dr. Chen had done impressive work. The seam where metal met flesh was barely visible now.

She flexed her fingers. Smooth. Precise. The combat package would've made them faster, stronger. It also would've made them less hers.

The ship's ambient hum surrounded her—life support cycling, reactor thrumming three decks below, the almost subsonic vibration of the damaged drive systems. She'd learned to read the Meridian's sounds the way some people read faces. Right now, the ship sounded tired.

Her neural implant chimed. Incoming message, priority encrypted.

Elena activated it, projecting the text onto her retina.

CLASSIFICATION: OMEGA BLACK  
FROM: ADMIRAL SARAH TORRES, FLEET INTELLIGENCE  
TO: CAPTAIN ELENA REEVES, MERIDIAN  

The Phobos connection is confirmed. You were right to pursue it. But you need to understand what you're dealing with.

The anomaly is not a ship. It's not a weapon. Current theory: it's a probe, possibly autonomous, studying human capabilities. Phobos was a test. You are another test.

Do not engage. Do not provoke. Your mission is observation only.

Fleet assets are en route. ETA: 19 days. Hold position and maintain distance.

This is a direct order, Captain. Stand down.

Elena read it twice. Then she deleted it.

Nineteen days. The Meridian would be debris in nineteen hours if this thing decided to move. Torres didn't understand—couldn't understand. She wasn't here. She hadn't seen the pattern.

The anomaly wasn't testing them. It was hunting them.

She pulled up the mission brief on her personal terminal. Project Threshold. Deliberate first contact with non-human intelligence. Fleet had chosen her specifically because of Phobos—because she'd survived when three hundred others hadn't. Because she understood the stakes.

But Torres wanted her to wait. To observe from a distance while the anomaly circled closer, learning their weaknesses, probing their defenses.

Katie had waited too. Followed protocol. Requested permission before every action, deferred to Fleet Command for tactical decisions. And when the crisis came, when the Phobos station started tearing itself apart, the orders had taken forty-seven minutes to arrive.

Forty-seven minutes. Katie had been dead for thirty.

Elena stood and checked her sidearm. Fully charged. She clipped it to her belt, then pulled on her duty jacket. The captain's insignia caught the light—two silver stars that felt heavier every day.

She moved to the viewport. Beyond the armored glass, space stretched infinite and cold. Somewhere out there, three hundred thousand klicks away, the anomaly waited. Patient. Intelligent. Unknown.

The stars didn't blink. They never did, not out here beyond the nebula's edge. Constant, ancient light from places so distant their origin worlds might already be ash. How many of those stars had seen civilizations rise and fall? How many anomalies like theirs drifted through the void, watching?

What if Torres was right? What if approaching it triggered the same cascade that destroyed Phobos?

What if waiting doomed them anyway?

The questions circled like predators. Elena pressed her palm—her real palm—against the cool glass. The warmth of her skin left a brief fog that faded in seconds. Temporary. Everything out here was temporary.

Elena's cybernetic fingers traced the edge of the viewport. The metal was cool, perfectly machined. Not like human skin. Not like Katie's hand in hers the last time they'd met, three months before Phobos. Katie had been excited—her first deep space command, her chance to prove herself.

"I'll make you proud," Katie had said.

Elena closed her eyes. The nightmares were always the same. Katie's face on the comm screen, calm even as the alarms screamed. "Tell Mom I love her. Tell her I—" And then static. Just static and silence and the knowledge that Elena had been too far away to help.

Her terminal beeped. Marcus.

"Captain, we're ready."

Elena opened her eyes. Her reflection stared back from the viewport—tired, haunted, determined. The cybernetic arm gleamed dully in the low light.

"On my way."

She took one last look at the photo of her sister. Katie had died on Phobos. Incinerated in the reactor breach when the AI went critical. Elena had been in command of the rescue mission that never came.

She picked up the frame, held it for a moment. Katie's smile was brilliant, unguarded. Before she knew what waited in the dark between stars.

"I'm sorry," Elena whispered. "I can't wait this time."

She set the photo down gently, precisely. Grabbed her command tablet from the desk. The duty roster glowed on the screen—ninety-six names, ninety-six lives depending on her judgment.

Torres's order echoed in her mind. Stand down. Wait for backup. Let someone else take the risk.

But Elena had spent two years running from Phobos. Running from the questions, the guilt, the screaming silence of three hundred dead. She'd taken this command because it was supposed to be different. Controlled. Safe.

Except nothing about this was safe. And if she waited nineteen days, they'd either be debris or the anomaly would be gone, disappeared back into whatever dimension it came from.

Katie had waited for orders. Elena wouldn't make the same mistake.

Nineteen days. Torres wanted her to wait nineteen days.

Elena had waited long enough.

She left her quarters and headed for the bridge. The corridor stretched ahead, lit by the emergency strips that had become standard since they'd lost thirty percent of main power. Crew members nodded as she passed—respect, trust, faith that she knew what she was doing.

She hoped they were right.

The ship's hum changed pitch. Reactor cycling up for increased demand. Chen was already preparing for whatever came next. Good. Her crew was ready.

Now Elena just had to make sure she was.

Time to finish what Phobos had started.
