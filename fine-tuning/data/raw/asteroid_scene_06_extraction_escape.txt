Kayla Okonkwo ran the fuel calculations for the third time and got the same grim result.

They had enough propellant for one significant burn. Either return to civilization for repairs, or maintain position at the consortium stronghold.

Not both.

She pulled up the tactical display. Six consortium ships holding position around the asteroid. Three corporate vessels watching from distance. And somewhere in the dark, more ships gathering.

The standoff wouldn't last forever.

"Captain, you need to see this." Kayla activated the long-range sensors.

Jax appeared on the bridge. "What've we got?"

"Eight more ships inbound. Corporate transponders. They'll arrive in forty-eight hours."

"Eight. Plus the three already here." Jax pulled up the consortium coordination. "We're outnumbered almost two to one."

"And outgunned. Those aren't mining ships—they're security vessels. Armed."

They watched the sensor tracks. The approaching fleet moved with military precision. Not independent ships. Coordinated force.

"Corporate's done negotiating," Jax said. "They're moving to seizure."

Kayla pulled up the fuel reserves. "We can run. Make it to the belt authority station. File formal complaints. Get legal protection."

"And abandon the asteroid?"

"And keep the crew alive." Kayla met his eyes. "Jax, we're miners. Not soldiers. If this turns into a shooting war, we lose."

"So we let corporate take it? Everything we found?"

"We let lawyers fight it. We already released the scientific data. The whole system knows what's here. Corporate can seize the asteroid, but they can't bury the discovery."

Jax was quiet. Calculating. Weighing pride against survival.

"What's Keiko say?" he asked.

Kayla pulled up the consortium channel. "She's proposing we hold position. United front. Make corporate work for it."

"Work meaning violence."

"Probably."

"And the other captains?"

"Split. Mbeki wants to fight. Ivanova wants to retreat. Captain Chen is calculating odds."

Jax activated the ship-wide comm. "Crew to the bridge. Now."

Sofia, Chen, and their two other crew members assembled within minutes. Jax laid out the situation.

"Eight corporate ships inbound. Armed. They're coming to take the asteroid by force. We have three options. Run and fight legally. Stay and resist physically. Or negotiate surrender terms."

"Surrender?" Chen's voice was sharp. "We found this. It's ours."

"Legally, yes. Practically, they have more guns."

Sofia pulled up the scientific data. "We already won the important fight. The discovery is public. Every research institution wants samples. Corporate can claim the asteroid, but they can't claim exclusive rights to the science."

"They can if they control all the material," Chen said.

"Not if we took samples before we leave." Sofia gestured at her lab. "I've got fifty kilos of processed mineral. Enough for every major research facility to study. Enough to ensure the knowledge spreads."

Kayla saw where this was going. "You're proposing we leave. But take samples with us. Seed the research community before corporate can lock it down."

"Exactly. We lose the asteroid. We win the revolution."

Jax thought about it. "What about the rest of the consortium?"

"That's their decision. But we can offer to extract samples for any ship that wants to retreat."

The comm buzzed. Keiko's voice: "All captains, emergency conference. Now."

The virtual meeting assembled. Six consortium captains facing the same calculation.

Keiko spoke first. "Corporate's sending force. We can fight or flee. I want opinions."

Captain Mbeki: "We fight. Make them pay for every meter. Show the belt that independents won't be bullied."

Captain Ivanova: "We retreat. Live to claim another day. Dead miners can't file lawsuits."

Captain Chen pulled up tactical analysis. "If we fight, we lose. Question is how badly. If we flee, we survive. Question is what we salvage."

Jax activated his feed. "I'm proposing a third option. We extract samples. Maximum material from the deposit. Then we scatter. Each ship takes samples to different research institutions. Corporate gets the asteroid. Science gets the revolution."

Silence. Then Keiko: "That's... actually smart. We lose the territory but win the war."

"Corporate wants exclusive control," Ivanova said. "This denies them that."

"It also requires us to run," Mbeki said. "To give up without fighting."

"To choose our battlefield," Jax corrected. "We can't win in space combat. But we can win in public opinion. In scientific advancement. In proving that independents can make discoveries that matter."

The debate ran for an hour. Pride versus pragmatism. Territory versus knowledge. Short-term loss versus long-term victory.

The vote was close. Four for extraction and retreat. Two for holding position.

"Extraction it is," Keiko said. "We have forty-eight hours. Pull every sample you can. Then scatter to different ports. Make corporate chase all of us or none of us."

The consortium ships moved into coordinated extraction. Mining equipment running at maximum. Pulling material faster than safety protocols recommended.

Kayla watched the operation and calculated fuel consumption. They could maintain extraction for thirty-six hours. Then they'd need to run.

"Sofia, how much can we pull?" Jax asked.

"Two hundred kilos if we push it. Enough for a dozen major institutions."

"Do it. Chen, prep the ship for fast departure. Kayla, plot exit vectors. I want options for three different destinations."

They worked through the extraction window. The Salvage Rights' hold filled with blue glowing mineral. Enough to change energy production. Enough to revolutionize physics.

Enough to make losing the asteroid worthwhile.

At thirty-six hours, the corporate fleet arrived.

"Consortium vessels, this is corporate security. You are ordered to cease operations and prepare for inspection."

Keiko responded: "Inspection refused. We're operating under proper claims and departing on our own schedule."

"Departure is not authorized. Remain in position."

"We're independent operators. Your authorization isn't required."

The corporate ships moved to intercept. Six targets. Eight pursuers. The math was not favorable.

"All ships, execute scatter pattern delta," Keiko ordered. "Meet at rendezvous coordinates. Don't look back."

The consortium ships burned hard. Different vectors. Different destinations. Maximum thrust away from the corporate fleet.

The Salvage Rights' engines screamed. Kayla pushed them past safety limits. Behind them, corporate ships gave chase.

But they'd split their force. Eight ships pursuing six targets. The numbers were better now.

"Three ships on our tail," Kayla reported. "We're faster, but not by much."

"How long can we sustain this burn?" Jax asked.

"Forty minutes. Then we're empty."

"Will that be enough?"

Kayla ran the calculations. "If we drop to minimal life support, shut down non-essentials, and pray? Maybe."

"That's our plan? Maybe?"

"That's every plan we've ever had."

They burned for forty minutes. The corporate ships fell behind. Not much, but enough.

When the tanks read empty, they coasted. Dead stick. No thrust. Just momentum and hope.

The corporate ships kept burning. Closed the distance. But slowly.

"They're going to catch us," Chen said.

"Not if we reach belt authority jurisdiction first," Kayla said. "Another hour and we're in protected space."

The pursuit stretched into the longest hour of Kayla's life. Dead ship. Corporate closing. Hope measured in kilometers.

Then they crossed the jurisdiction line.

"Belt authority space," Kayla announced. "We're legal now."

The corporate ships stopped pursuit. Hung at the boundary. Frustrated but bound by treaties.

Jax activated the comm. "Thanks for the escort, corporate. We'll file our thanks formally through legal channels."

The response was silence. Corporate ships turning away. Defeated.

For now.

Kayla pulled up their position. Three days from the nearest station. Zero fuel. Minimal life support.

"We're going to need a tow," she said.

"We're alive to need it," Jax said. "That counts as winning."

In the hold, two hundred kilos of impossible physics waited. 

They'd lost the asteroid.

But they'd won the future.

And sometimes, that was enough.
