Alexis stood in the fabrication bay, watching the 3D printer slowly construct a replacement valve assembly. Layer by layer, micron by micron, building something from nothing.

Or rather, from Martian regolith and recycled polymers. Nothing was ever really from nothing on Mars.

The printer would take another six hours. She should leave, get some sleep, trust the automated systems to finish the job.

Instead, she pulled up a chair and watched.

There was something meditative about it. The precision. The patience. The absolute certainty that if you did each step correctly, the final product would work.

Unlike everything else on Mars, which was held together by improvisation and prayer.

"You're still here."

Sofia Reyes appeared with two coffee bulbs. She handed one to Alexis and sat down.

"Couldn't leave it unsupervised."

"The printer has been running unsupervised for three years. It'll be fine." Sofia sipped her coffee. "How long since you slept?"

"Define 'slept.'"

"More than two hours consecutively."

Alexis had to think about it. "Thursday?"

"It's Saturday."

"Then two days." Alexis rubbed her face. "There's too much to do, Sofia. Module Four repairs, the new life support expansion, Hassan's excavation equipment, routine maintenance that's three weeks overdue. We're drowning."

"So delegate. That's what you have a team for."

"I am delegating. But I still need to oversee—"

"No, you need to trust." Sofia gestured at the printer. "You trust that machine to build a valve assembly without supervision. Trust your crew the same way. We're not going to break the colony while you sleep."

Alexis wanted to argue. But Sofia was right. She'd been micromanaging, double-checking everyone's work, taking on tasks that her team could handle.

"I'm afraid," she admitted quietly. "Every time I close my eyes, I see that hull breach. The three people we almost lost. And I think: what if I'd been asleep? What if I'd delegated to someone less experienced? What if—"

"What if you burn out and collapse, and then who runs engineering?" Sofia's voice was gentle but firm. "You saved three lives because you were sharp, rested, ready. Keep running on no sleep and eventually you'll make a mistake that costs lives instead of saving them."

"When did you become the wise one?"

"I've always been wise. You were just too busy being brilliant to notice." Sofia stood. "Go to bed, Chief. That's an order from your subordinate."

"That's not how orders work."

"It is now. Bed. Eight hours minimum. I'll monitor the printer and wake you if anything critical happens."

Alexis looked at the valve assembly, half-formed in the printer's build chamber. Then at Sofia, who had her arms crossed and wasn't backing down.

"Fine. Eight hours. But if anything—"

"I'll call you. Now go before I get Yuki to sedate you."

Alexis stumbled to her quarters, stripped off her jumpsuit, and collapsed onto her bunk. Sleep came instantly, dreamless and total.

She woke to her alarm twelve hours later. Not eight. Twelve.

Sofia had disabled her early alert.

Alexis pulled up her comm, ready to be angry, and found a message: "Everything's fine. Module Four repairs on schedule. Valve assembly completed successfully. You needed the sleep more than we needed you micromanaging. —Sofia"

Attached was the daily status report. All green. Every system running smoothly.

Her team had handled everything without her.

Alexis sat on the edge of her bunk and felt something loosen in her chest. Pride, maybe. Or relief.

She'd built a good team. Trained them well. They could handle the routine crises without her constant oversight.

Maybe she didn't need to carry everything alone.

She showered, dressed, and headed for the fabrication bay. The valve assembly sat in the completed projects bin, perfect and ready for installation.

Sofia was at her workstation, running stress tests on a hull panel.

"You disabled my alarm."

"You're welcome." Sofia didn't look up. "How do you feel?"

"Better. Angry at you for overriding my settings. But better."

"I'll take it." Sofia highlighted something on her display. "While you were unconscious, I finished the Module Four structural analysis. We can start repairs tomorrow if you approve the plan."

Alexis reviewed the documents. Thorough. Detailed. Exactly what she would have done.

"It's good work. Approved."

"See? We don't need you hovering." Sofia grinned. "Though we do appreciate your occasionally brilliant insights."

Alexis pulled up the maintenance schedule and started redistributing tasks. Properly this time, giving her team real ownership of their projects instead of just rubber-stamping her decisions.

It felt strange. Uncomfortable. Like letting go of control.

But also necessary.

Over the next week, Alexis forced herself to step back. To delegate not just tasks, but authority. To trust her team to make decisions without checking with her first.

It was terrifying.

It was also liberating.

Marcus Wu took over the solar array restoration. Made decisions about panel orientation that Alexis wouldn't have made, but that worked just as well.

Sofia led the Module Four reconstruction. Improvised solutions that Alexis found elegant and efficient.

Hassan coordinated the excavation equipment fabrication. Designed custom tools that Alexis hadn't thought of.

They were good. All of them. They'd been good all along.

Alexis had just been too focused on being essential to notice.

Two weeks after her twelve-hour sleep marathon, Rivera called her to the office.

"I've been reviewing the engineering department performance metrics."

Alexis braced for criticism. "If this is about the delayed maintenance—"

"This is about the fact that you've completed thirty percent more projects this month than last month, with better quality outcomes and fewer critical errors." Rivera pulled up the data. "What changed?"

"I started trusting my team."

"Took you long enough." Rivera smiled. "Alexis, you're brilliant. But you're not omniscient, and you're not immortal. The colony needs you sharp, not exhausted. Keep delegating. Keep trusting. That's how we build something that lasts."

Alexis nodded. "I'm learning."

"Good. Because I'm about to give you another challenge." Rivera transferred a file. "The next supply ship is bringing component kits for two additional habitat modules. I need you to oversee the assembly."

"That's a six-month project."

"Which is why you'll need to delegate most of it. I want you focused on system integration and quality control. Let your team handle the day-to-day construction."

It was a test. Alexis recognized that. A chance to prove she'd actually learned the lesson.

"I'll do it. But I'll need Marcus and Sofia promoted to senior engineer positions. If they're going to handle module construction, they need the authority to make final decisions."

Rivera considered that. "Done. Submit the promotion paperwork and I'll approve it."

After the meeting, Alexis found Marcus and Sofia in the fabrication bay and delivered the news.

"You're promoting us?" Marcus looked stunned.

"You've earned it. And I need senior engineers I can trust to run major projects without constant supervision." Alexis pulled up the module assembly timeline. "Think you can handle building two habitats?"

Sofia and Marcus exchanged glances.

"We can handle it," Sofia said. "But you have to promise to actually let us handle it. No checking our work every hour."

"Once a day. Tops."

"Deal."

They shook on it.

Alexis walked back to her quarters feeling lighter than she had in months. Her team was growing. The colony was growing. And she was learning to let go of control long enough to let others shine.

Small victories.

They added up to something bigger.

To trust. To sustainability. To a future that didn't depend on one person carrying the weight of an entire world.

Alexis pulled up the module assembly plans and began drafting the delegation assignments.

This time, she was ready to let her team lead.

And maybe, just maybe, that would make all the difference.
