Fleet Admiral Kowalski's face filled the communication screen. He didn't look happy.

"Marcus, I've reviewed your report. Comprehensive. Well-documented. And completely unacceptable."

Marcus kept his expression neutral. He'd expected pushback. "Sir, the evidence supports our conclusions. Kepler-442d is biochemically incompatible with human colonization."

"Eighteen thousand colonists are in transit based on preliminary survey data showing this planet as our best prospect. You're telling me to redirect them where, exactly?"

"Kepler-452b shows promise. We're en route now for full survey."

"And if that fails? If the next three planets fail? How long do we keep those ships in transit?"

Marcus pulled up the colonist ship specs. Life support capacity for forty-eight months. They'd already used eighteen months. Time was running out.

"Sir, I understand the pressure. But recommending Kepler-442d for colonization would be condemning those colonists to neurological damage within a year. Possible population collapse within five years."

"Based on three weeks of exposure."

"Three weeks was enough to cause measurable harm to my team. Dr. Chen's medical data is in the appendices. We were approaching permanent damage thresholds."

Kowalski pulled up something off-screen. "I have corporate interests asking why we're not pursuing atmospheric processing solutions. They claim the neurotoxic compounds could be filtered."

"They could. With custom-designed filtration systems that don't currently exist. And colonists would need to maintain perfect containment protocols indefinitely. One breach, one filter failure, and people die."

"People die in space too. Accidents happen. That's the reality of colonization."

Marcus felt his jaw tighten. "There's a difference between accepting calculated risks and ignoring fundamental biochemical incompatibility. Sir, the planet has two independent biospheres. Silicon-based and sulfur-based. We don't understand how they interact. We don't know what introducing Earth biology would do to their equilibrium."

"The planetary protection protocols are advisory, Commander. Not mandatory."

"They exist for a reason. We don't have the right to disrupt alien ecosystems because we need resources."

Kowalski's expression hardened. "What we need are habitable worlds. Earth is overcrowded. The stations are past capacity. Those eighteen thousand colonists represent families, Marcus. Children. They've sacrificed everything for the chance at planetary life."

"I know. And I want to give them that. But Kepler-442d isn't the answer."

"So you say. But I have engineers telling me atmospheric processing is solvable. Biologists saying we can adapt to the silicon-carbon compounds with proper medical protocols. Economists calculating that the resource investment is justified given the planet's otherwise ideal conditions."

Marcus pulled up the atmospheric transition data. "The planet's oxygen levels are increasing. Projections show potentially catastrophic conditions within a few centuries. We'd be establishing colonies on a world in the middle of a major atmospheric transformation."

"A few centuries is longer than most human civilizations last."

"That's a shortsighted perspective, sir. We're trying to build humanity's future. That requires thinking in generational timescales."

Kowalski was quiet for a moment. "You know what I'm going to ask."

"You're going to ask if I'm being overly cautious. If the risks are really as severe as I'm claiming."

"Are you?"

Marcus thought about Rafael's dopamine spike. Ling's cellular damage. Priya's tremors. His own immune activation that Dr. Chen said was early-stage inflammatory response to chronic toxin exposure.

"No, sir. If anything, we're underestimating the risks. We only surveyed one small region. There could be worse biochemical hazards we didn't encounter."

"Or better regions. Areas where the silicon photosynthesizers are less concentrated. Where the neurotoxic compounds are lower."

"The high-altitude zones show promise. But they're isolated, resource-poor, and would limit colonists to a fraction of the planet's surface. That's not the colonization outcome anyone wants."

Kowalski pulled up something else off-screen. "I'm authorizing a second survey team. Independent review of your findings. They'll have six weeks to verify your conclusions or identify solutions you missed."

Marcus felt a flash of anger. "You're questioning my team's competence?"

"I'm ensuring we've explored all options before abandoning our best colonization prospect. You'd do the same in my position."

That was probably true. But it didn't make the implied criticism sting less.

"When does the second team arrive?"

"They're launching from the orbital station now. Should reach Kepler-442d in three weeks."

"We're heading to Kepler-452b. We won't be there to brief them."

"They have your comprehensive report. They'll manage."

Marcus pulled up the second team's roster. Dr. Sarah Chen—no relation to their ship's doctor. Engineering specialist Rodriguez. Biochemist Yamamoto. Atmospheric scientist Okonkwo.

Competent people. Good scientists. And they'd reach the same conclusions his team had.

Unless corporate pressure influenced their assessments.

"Sir, if the second team recommends colonization, I want it on record that I object. The medical data is clear. The contamination risks are real. Kepler-442d will poison colonists."

"Your objection is noted, Commander. Now get to Kepler-452b and see if it's any better."

The communication ended. Marcus stared at the blank screen, feeling the weight of Fleet politics crushing down on his scientific conclusions.

He pulled up the full colonization assessment. Forty-seven pages of data. Medical evidence. Atmospheric analysis. Biological surveys. Contamination tests.

All of it pointing to one conclusion—don't colonize Kepler-442d.

And Fleet was sending another team to challenge that conclusion.

Marcus pulled up the second team's orders. They were being asked to "verify or refine" his team's findings. Corporate language for "find a way to make colonization work."

He started composing an encrypted message to the second team lead. Professional warnings. Specific recommendations for safety protocols. Medical thresholds to watch for.

If they were going to repeat his survey, at least he could help them avoid the worst of the neurotoxic exposure.

The message sent, Marcus pulled up Kepler-452b's preliminary data. Slightly larger than Earth. Slightly cooler. Atmospheric composition showed oxygen-nitrogen mix in reasonable ratios.

But they'd thought Kepler-442d looked good from preliminary data too.

Until they landed and started breathing poison.

Marcus activated the shipwide comm. "All personnel, this is Commander Osei. Fleet has authorized a second survey team for Kepler-442d. They'll be arriving in three weeks to verify our findings. In the meantime, we're proceeding to Kepler-452b. Survey operations will commence upon arrival. That is all."

He pulled up the medical logs. His team was still recovering. Rafael's dopamine levels normalizing. Ling's fatigue improving. Priya's tremors fading.

They'd been lucky. Another week of exposure and the damage could have been permanent.

Marcus pulled up images of Kepler-442d one last time. Beautiful rust-colored continents. Crystal forests glowing with bioluminescence. Dual biospheres creating chemical complexity Earth had never achieved.

A planet that could have been humanity's new home.

If only the chemistry had aligned.

If only life had evolved in ways compatible with human biology.

If only the universe designed planets for humanity's convenience instead of following its own rules.

Marcus closed the images and focused on Kepler-452b.

Another planet. Another hope. Another survey that might reveal beautiful incompatibilities.

But he'd keep looking. Keep documenting. Keep telling the truth about what each world offered.

Even when that truth disappointed Fleet Command.

Even when corporate interests wanted different conclusions.

Even when eighteen thousand colonists needed him to find something his data didn't support.

Science demanded honesty. And Marcus would give them that, regardless of the pressure to do otherwise.

The second survey team would reach their own conclusions. Maybe they'd find solutions his team missed. Maybe they'd confirm the incompatibility.

Either way, Marcus had done his job. Documented the risks. Provided evidence.

Now he had to find a planet that didn't require compromising his professional integrity to recommend.

A world where the data said "yes" instead of "beautiful but deadly."

Somewhere in the galaxy, that world existed.

Marcus just hoped they'd find it before the colonist ships ran out of time.
