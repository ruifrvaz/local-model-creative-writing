Chen "Wrench" Liu pulled the damaged power coupling from the Falcon's starboard engine. The metal was scored, cracked, nearly failed.

"Cap, we have a problem."

Jax Torres appeared in the engine bay within seconds. "Define problem."

"This coupling is end-of-life. Another ten hours of hard burn and it fails completely. When it does, we lose the starboard engine."

"Can you repair it?"

"I can patch it. Might hold for another month. Might fail tomorrow. This is original equipment, Cap. Twenty years old. We're past warranty and into borrowed time."

Jax ran calculations. The Falcon was making good money from the concentrated platinum deposits. But every credit was allocated to debt repayment and maintaining their expanded four-person crew.

New power couplings cost eight thousand credits.

They didn't have eight thousand credits to spare.

"Patch it," Jax decided. "We'll run conservative thrust profiles until we can afford a proper replacement."

"Conservative thrust means longer transit times. That eats into profit margins."

"I'm aware. But losing an engine entirely eats into them more."

Chen went to work. Jax stayed, watching the repair process. The Falcon was showing its age everywhere. Hull stress fractures. Worn bearings. Aging electronics. Patched and repatched systems held together by Chen's expertise and desperation.

Eventually, something would fail catastrophically. When it did, they'd need resources they didn't have.

Maya Santos found him in the engine bay three hours later.

"Heard about the coupling. I've been reviewing our financials. We can afford a new one if we defer crew payments for two months."

"I'm not asking you to work without pay."

"You're not asking. I'm offering. Cap, I've been on this crew for four months. You saved my life. You gave me a future. Two months without pay is small price for that."

Jax looked at the young engineer. She meant it. But accepting felt like failure. Like admitting he couldn't take care of his crew.

"I'll think about it."

"Think fast. Because Kayla and Sofia made the same offer. We're all willing to defer payment for critical repairs."

That stopped him. "You talked to them about this?"

"Crew meeting while you were on the bridge. We voted. Unanimous. Ship maintenance comes first. We get paid when the Falcon's healthy."

Jax felt something tight in his chest. Gratitude mixed with shame. "You shouldn't have to make that choice."

"It's not a choice. It's an investment. This ship is our livelihood. Keeping her running is everyone's responsibility." Santos pulled up repair schedules. "While we're at it, there are seven other components approaching end-of-life. We should address them all at once. Save on shipping costs."

"How much total?"

"Thirty-two thousand credits."

Jax sat down hard. Thirty-two thousand. More than their debt payment was each month. It would set them back six months on the path to financial freedom.

But Santos was right. These repairs weren't optional. They were survival.

"Get quotes from three suppliers. Choose the best value, not necessarily the cheapest. I want quality parts this time."

"And crew payment?"

"Everyone gets base stipend. Enough for personal supplies and communication with family. The rest goes to ship repairs. When we're through this, I'll make it up to you."

"Don't worry about making it up. Just keep us flying."

The parts arrived three weeks later. Chen and Santos worked sixteen-hour days installing them. New power couplings. Updated sensor arrays. Reinforced hull bracing. A better medical kit for Sofia's secondary role.

The Falcon emerged from the refit stronger. Not new, but functional. Reliable. Able to handle the demands they placed on it.

And Jax's crew had aged faces from the work and the deferred compensation. But they were smiling. Proud of what they'd accomplished.

"She runs better," Kayla reported from the cockpit. "Engine response is cleaner. Navigation systems are more accurate. This was worth it."

Jax looked at the financial statements. They'd blown through their savings. Set back their debt repayment by seven months. Extended their indentured period to the loan holders.

But they'd survive. That was worth the cost.

"All right, crew. We have work to catch up on. That platinum asteroid Sofia identified isn't going to mine itself." Jax pulled up the course plot. "Three-day burn at standard thrust. Then two weeks of mining operations. Everyone earn your deferred pay?"

Affirmatives all around.

The Falcon broke orbit from the repair station, engines burning clean and strong. Through the viewports, the asteroid belt stretched infinite and hostile and full of possibility.

They were still in debt. Still one major failure away from losing everything. Still fighting against corporations with more resources and fewer scruples.

But they were alive. They were together. And they had a ship that could take them anywhere in the belt.

For an independent mining crew, that was everything.

Jax watched his crew work—Kayla plotting nav courses, Sofia analyzing survey data, Chen and Santos conducting post-refit checks. Each person essential. Each person committed.

A family. Built in space, forged in crisis, strengthened through shared sacrifice.

"Cap," Sofia called. "I'm seeing something interesting in the survey data. Another concentrated mineral deposit. Looks like rare earth elements this time."

"How concentrated?"

"Very. If the readings are accurate, we're looking at six months of profitable mining."

"Set course. Let's turn this setback into an opportunity."

The Falcon adjusted trajectory, chasing Sofia's survey contacts. Behind them, the repair station dwindled to a distant light.

Ahead, possibility beckoned.

They'd chase it. Catch it. Extract value from ancient rock.

Then do it again. And again. Until the debt was paid and they were truly free.

However long that took.

They had time. They had each other. They had a ship that worked.

Everything else would follow.

Eventually.

The belt demanded patience.

Jax Torres had learned that lesson well.

He'd keep learning it.

For as long as necessary.

The Falcon flew on.

Into the dark. Into the future. Into whatever came next.

Together.

Always together.

That was the real treasure.

Everything else was just ore.
