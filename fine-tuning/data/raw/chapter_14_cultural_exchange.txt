The jump drive chamber was never supposed to be accessed during flight. Emergency protocols kept it sealed—too much radiation, too much quantum uncertainty. But Chen needed parts, and the parts were in there.

Elena suited up beside her. "Talk me through this."

"We crack the seal, I grab the primary coil housing, we reseal before the radiation dose gets dangerous." Chen checked her dosimeter. "Three minutes, max."

"And if something goes wrong?"

"Then we both get cancer in twenty years instead of thirty." Chen activated the airlock. "Ready?"

They cycled through. The chamber beyond was a cathedral of impossible physics—the jump drive core suspended in a magnetic field, surrounded by coils that bent spacetime like clay. It pulsed with a deep violet light that made Elena's implants ache.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Chen moved to the equipment lockers. "We're looking at the most complex machine humanity ever built. And we're cannibalizing it for parts."

"Will we be able to jump again?"

"Eventually. If we survive long enough to reinstall this." Chen pulled out a cylindrical housing the size of her torso. "Got it. Let's go."

They were halfway back when the anomaly transmitted.

Elena felt it through her neural link—not words, not images, but pure concept. Understanding. Recognition. The anomaly had noticed them inside the quantum field.

"Chen, move!"

They scrambled for the airlock. Behind them, the jump drive core flickered. The magnetic containment wavered.

"What's happening?" Chen shouted over the alarms.

"It's scanning the drive!" Elena pulled her through the inner door. "It wants to understand how we move through space!"

The airlock sealed. Through the glassteel viewport, Elena watched the core stabilize. The anomaly's interest faded, withdrawing like a curious hand pulling back from a hot stove.

Chen slumped against the wall, breathing hard. "Did it just... poke our jump drive?"

"I think it did more than poke. I think it learned how to build one." Elena checked the core readings. Everything normal. No damage. Just... examined.

"Captain, if it can replicate our technology—"

"It's not interested in our technology. It already has better." Elena helped Chen to her feet. "It's interested in us. How we think. How we solve problems."

"That's almost worse."

Elena couldn't argue with that.

They hauled the coil housing to engineering, where Chen's team waited with tools and worried expressions. The installation would take hours—hours they didn't have, with hull integrity failing and Fleet Command threatening court-martial.

But Elena had learned something in that chamber. The anomaly wasn't hostile. It was curious. And curiosity, at least, she could work with.

"Marcus," she said over comms. "I need you to set up another test."

"What kind of test?"

"The kind where we show it something interesting and see what it does." Elena watched Chen's team work. "If it wants to understand us, let's give it a puzzle it can't solve with pure mathematics."

"Like what?"

Elena thought of Katie. Of Phobos. Of three hundred people who died because two different forms of intelligence couldn't find common ground.

"Art," she said. "Music. Poetry. The things that make us human beyond our technology."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. "That's actually brilliant."

"Or completely insane. Hard to tell the difference out here." Elena headed for the bridge. "Assemble a cultural database. Everything from Bach to Basho. We're going to teach an ancient alien intelligence what it means to be human."

"And if it doesn't care?"

"Then at least we tried something new." Elena entered the bridge. The anomaly hung in the viewport, patient and eternal. "Better than dying because we were too afraid to be ourselves."

She settled into the captain's chair and opened a comm channel to the entire crew.

"This is Captain Reeves. We're about to try something unprecedented. Each of you has seven minutes to record a message—anything you want the anomaly to hear. A song, a poem, a story, a memory. Whatever makes you who you are."

Silence on the line.

"Seven minutes, people. Make them count."

The responses started slowly. Then faster. Ensign Martinez singing a lullaby his mother taught him. Okonkwo reciting Shakespeare. Patel explaining the beauty of prime numbers. Chen describing the smell of her grandmother's kitchen.

Humanity, compressed into data streams and sent into the dark.

Elena added her own—a memory of Katie, age eight, catching fireflies in a jar and letting them go because she couldn't stand to see them trapped.

The anomaly received it all. And for the first time since contact began, it responded with something that felt like joy.
