Dr. Eva Sato sat in the archives and listened to voices of the dead.

"This is Mission Commander Patricia Liu. Day one of the Perseverance mission. We carry with us the hopes of Earth. Ten thousand frozen embryos. Cultural archives spanning human civilization. And the dreams of a species reaching for the stars."

Eva paused the recording. Commander Liu had been dead for a hundred and sixty years. But her voice was clear, confident. Certain that sending three thousand people on a four-hundred-year journey was the right choice.

Eva wasn't so certain anymore.

She pulled up the next recording. Generation twelve, her own great-grandmother.

"This is Captain Sarah Sato. Year one-ninety-two. We've detected anomalous readings in the stellar system ahead. Captain's log notes that mission parameters may require adjustment."

The anomalous readings had been the planet. The one the council voted to ignore.

Eva's great-grandmother had known about it. Had filed reports. Had been overruled by a council that prioritized mission completion over opportunity.

History repeating.

Eva closed the archives and made her way to the observation dome. Malik was there again, watching the planet recede. They'd passed it. The vote was executed. The ship continued toward Kepler-442b.

"Can't let it go?" Malik asked.

"Can you?" Eva gestured at the viewport. "That planet might have been our home."

"Or our grave."

"Everything's a grave eventually."

Malik was quiet. They watched the planet shrink to a point of light.

"My great-grandmother knew about it," Eva said. "The planet. It's in the archives. She wanted to investigate. Got overruled."

"Mission parameters."

"Mission parameters written by people who never had to live them." Eva pulled up her tablet. "I've been reading the original mission documents. You know what's interesting? The planners debated the timeline. Some wanted three hundred years. Some wanted five hundred. They compromised at four hundred."

"So?"

"So the number's arbitrary. Based on fuel calculations and resource projections. Not on some cosmic significance. We could have arrived a century ago. Or we might not arrive for another century. It's all just math and hope."

Malik turned from the viewport. "What's your point?"

"My point is we're sacrificing lives for a plan that was always a guess. Three thousand people living and dying in this ship because someone two hundred years ago ran calculations and made estimates."

"Better than chaos. Better than making it up as we go."

"Is it?" Eva pulled up the genetic diversity reports. "Medical says we're borderline viable. Another hundred years, we might not be able to sustain the population. But we're committed to the mission because... why? Because our ancestors said so?"

"Because giving up means their sacrifice was meaningless."

"Their sacrifice was sending us. Not condemning us."

Malik's expression hardened. "You want to turn the ship around. Go back to the planet."

"I want to discuss it as an option. Without being shut down by mission orthodoxy."

"The council voted."

"Eighteen to fifteen. Hardly a mandate." Eva sat beside him. "Malik, I'm not trying to undermine the mission. I'm trying to save the people on it."

"By abandoning everything we've worked toward."

"By adapting to reality. The plan was always aspirational. We're living the actual mission. And the actual mission is harder than anyone expected."

Malik pulled up the ship's status. "The conservation measures will work. We can complete the voyage."

"At what cost? Reduced reproduction. Stricter resource rationing. Generations living with less because we're committed to a destination most of them will never see."

"That was always the deal. Generation ship means sacrifice."

"It means each generation choosing to continue. Not being bound by choices they didn't make."

They sat in silence. The planet was gone now. Just another star in the endless field.

"What would you tell them?" Malik asked. "The people who sent us. If you could talk to them."

Eva thought about it. "I'd ask if they really understood what they were doing. Sending three thousand people on a journey that would span ten generations. Asking us to give up lives, dreams, everything that makes existence worth living, for a plan that might not even work."

"And if they said yes? That they understood and still thought it was worth it?"

"I'd ask them to live it. Spend two hundred years in corridors. Never see Earth. Never have a choice about where you go or what you do. Then tell me it's worth it."

Malik was quiet for a long time. "My grandfather was chief engineer. He spent forty years maintaining systems so I could be here. He died never knowing if the mission would succeed."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. He chose it. Chose to believe the mission mattered more than his comfort."

"And you believe that too."

"I believe we honor the dead by finishing what they started."

Eva pulled up the cultural archives. Music, art, literature. Everything humanity had created, preserved in digital format.

"You know what I spend my time doing?" she said. "Preserving culture for people two hundred years from now. Making sure they remember Earth. Remember what it meant to have a home planet."

"That's important work."

"Is it? Or am I just cataloging relics for a generation that won't care? They'll have been born in space. Died in space. Earth will be mythology to them."

"Then make it good mythology. Give them something worth remembering."

Eva laughed bitterly. "You're an optimist."

"I'm a realist. The mission is happening whether we like it or not. Question is what we do with it."

"We could change it. Turn around. Give three thousand people a chance at a real life."

"Or condemn them to an unknown world with unknown risks."

They were back to the fundamental disagreement. Safety of the known versus possibility of the unknown.

Eva stood. "The council meets again in six months. Review of conservation measures. I'm putting the planet back on the agenda."

"Eva—"

"I'm not giving up, Malik. Three thousand people deserve a choice. Not just acceptance of a plan they didn't make."

She left him there, watching the stars. Alone with the weight of a mission that would outlive them both.

Back in the archives, Eva pulled up the recording again. Commander Liu's voice, clear and confident.

"We carry with us the hopes of Earth."

Eva wondered if Earth's hopes were worth three thousand lives. Worth ten generations of sacrifice. Worth the possibility that they'd arrive at Kepler-442b only to find it uninhabitable or already occupied or simply not worth the journey.

She started drafting her proposal for the next council meeting. Data on the planet. Risk assessments. Arguments for adaptability versus adherence to plan.

It probably wouldn't change anything. The ship would continue. The mission would proceed.

But Eva Sato was a historian. She understood that small voices, repeated persistently, sometimes changed the course of empires.

Or generation ships.

She saved her work and closed the archives. Somewhere ahead, two hundred years ahead, Kepler-442b waited.

Behind them, slowly receding, a planet that might have been home.

Eva didn't know which choice was right.

But she knew they deserved to make it themselves.
