Station Director Kwame Nkrumah watched the delegates leave with cautious optimism.

The sabotage had been thwarted. The third-party manipulation exposed. Coalition and Independents were actually talking instead of posturing.

Small victories. But victories nonetheless.

Ambassador Chen Wu joined him at the observation window. "That could have gone much worse."

"It's not over. Helios Mining Consortium will try again. Different tactics. Different targets."

"Then we prepare different defenses." Chen pulled up security protocols. "Volkov's already implementing enhanced screening. Biometric verification. Continuous monitoring."

"Which the delegates will resent."

"They'll resent war more." Chen turned from the window. "Director, we need to discuss station policy. Neutrality works when both sides trust us. But active sabotage changes the equation."

"How so?"

"If third parties can infiltrate our security, our neutrality becomes liability instead of asset. Delegates won't feel safe here."

Nkrumah understood the problem. Station Kepler's value was neutral ground. But neutral didn't mean undefended.

"Recommendations?"

"Upgrade security. Significantly. Dedicated intelligence team. Advanced sensor networks. Maybe even armed guards for diplomatic sessions."

"Armed guards violate neutrality principles."

"Dead diplomats violate peace negotiations." Chen pulled up casualty scenarios. "If someone had succeeded today—if delegates had died—both sides would blame us. Neutrality wouldn't protect us. It would paint targets on our backs."

Nkrumah moved to his desk. The decisions were getting harder. Balancing principles against practicality. Ideals against survival.

"I'll authorize enhanced security. But subtly. We maintain appearance of open neutrality while actually implementing hardened protocols."

"Security theater?"

"Security reality with diplomatic packaging." Nkrumah pulled up the station budget. "How much will this cost?"

"Fifteen percent increase in operating expenses. Maybe twenty."

"Which we can't afford without raising docking fees."

"Which will anger everyone using the station."

Nkrumah ran the numbers. Higher fees meant fewer visitors. Fewer visitors meant less economic activity. Less economic activity meant station decline.

But inadequate security meant sabotage. War. Destruction.

Between economic strain and diplomatic failure, he'd choose economic strain every time.

"Implement the upgrades. I'll handle the political fallout."

Chen nodded and left. Nkrumah sat alone, thinking about the precarious balance he'd committed to maintaining.

His comm chimed. Dr. Sarah Okonkwo, the station's medical officer.

"Director, I need to report something. Medical surveillance detected unusual biochemical signatures in three delegates."

"Unusual how?"

"Consistent with cognitive enhancement drugs. Nootropics. Nothing illegal, but definitely giving users advantages in negotiations."

"Which delegates?"

"One Coalition. One Independent. One from the neutral observer bloc."

"So everyone's cheating."

"Or everyone's trying to maintain parity with suspected cheating by others." Okonkwo pulled up the chemical analyses. "The drugs aren't dangerous. But they do enhance focus, memory, and decision-making speed."

Nkrumah felt tired. "What do you recommend?"

"Medical screening before negotiations. Level playing field. Nobody gets chemical advantages."

"The delegates will claim privacy violation."

"The delegates are using our station for advantages we didn't approve. This is our facility. Our rules."

Nkrumah made another decision he'd probably regret. "Implement screening. Medical justification—station health standards. Frame it as protecting everyone, not targeting specific parties."

"Understood."

She closed the comm. Nkrumah added it to the growing list of policy changes. Enhanced security. Mandatory screening. Increased fees.

The neutral station was becoming less neutral. More regulated. More controlled.

Necessary changes. But changes that eroded the principles he'd built the station's reputation on.

Lena Volkov entered without knocking. The security chief looked grim.

"We decrypted more of the saboteur's data chip. You need to see this."

She pulled up financial records. Extensive. Detailed. Showing payments from multiple parties.

Not just Helios Mining Consortium. But corporations from both Coalition and Independent territories. All funding the same operative. All with the same goal: disrupt negotiations.

"They're all manipulating us," Nkrumah said quietly.

"Looks like it. Peace talks were theater. Everyone wanted them to fail so they could justify continued conflict."

"Except the people actually trying to negotiate in good faith."

"Who are the minority. Most delegates are following orders from interests that profit from tension."

Nkrumah studied the data. Payments. Schedules. Coordinated timing.

The sabotage wasn't random. It was orchestrated. By multiple parties with aligned incentives.

"We can't tell the delegates," he said.

"Why not? They deserve to know they're being played."

"Because some already know. Some are complicit. Revealing it would force them to pick sides. Probably violently."

Volkov was quiet. Then: "So we keep them ignorant and hope they accidentally achieve peace?"

"We give them the environment where peace is possible. What they do with it is their choice."

"That's frustratingly idealistic."

"That's the job." Nkrumah pulled up the station charter. "We maintain neutral ground. We can't force outcomes. We can only create possibilities."

Volkov studied him. "You really believe that?"

"I have to. The alternative is abandoning neutrality and picking sides. Which makes us another combatant, not a mediator."

"And if neutrality fails? If the station becomes a target?"

"Then we evacuate and hope someone else builds another neutral ground." Nkrumah stood. "But I'm not ready to give up yet. This station matters. What it represents matters."

"Even when what it represents is a convenient fiction?"

"Especially then. Fictions become reality when enough people believe in them. Peace negotiations are fiction until they produce actual peace. Neutrality is fiction until it prevents actual war."

"That's very philosophical."

"That's very necessary." Nkrumah moved to the window. "We're three hundred kilometers above Earth. Between warring factions. Maintained by principles that everyone violates while pretending to honor."

"So we're doomed."

"Or we're humanity's best hope. Depends on the day." He turned back to Volkov. "Increase security. Monitor everyone. Expect betrayal. But keep the doors open. Keep the talks happening. Keep the fiction alive."

"Until it becomes reality."

"Until it becomes reality."

Volkov left. Nkrumah stood at the window, watching Earth rotate below.

Eight billion people. Thousands of factions. Competing interests pulling in every direction.

And one station trying to hold the center. Maintaining neutral ground through diplomatic fiction and stubborn determination.

It was probably futile. Possibly delusional. Definitely exhausting.

But it was the only option between cooperation and conflict. Between dialogue and war.

So Nkrumah would maintain it. For as long as possible. Against whatever odds.

Because someone had to believe peace was possible.

Even when everyone else was betting on war.

That was leadership. Not knowing the outcome. Just committing to the attempt.

And hoping it was enough.
