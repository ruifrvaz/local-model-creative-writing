Third memory - When drifters race

[...] is Remgast, the metropolis that hosts the drifter races, and the only pyrean construct that matches the greatness and technological marvel of Darm. Although inviting apprentices to the Shelter does not directly justify the risk of exposing our entire operation, these games provide the apprentices a direct exposure to the reality outside of Darm, which consequently helps gather supporters for the Uprising. When we have gathered enough supporters, we will set our plan into motion. We will begin by ***FILE CORRUPTED*** they were waiting for us in the tunnels. I don't understand how they found us. I cleared my mind from any thought. I made no ***FILE CORRUPTED*** knew our plan from the start. And now Vittas has killed Von Howitt and I am trapped inside an Air Intake Field. I will not last through the night. They will come for ***FILE CORRUPTED***

An excerpt from the captured log-files of the Silent Uprising;
Division of Darmian Security under the authority of Mentalist Vittas;


The dimly lit chamber had a cozy appearance. It had a low ceiling, a fluffy dark-grey carpet, and a row of six stuffed armchairs with their backs turned to six corresponding holoscreens, thin malleable screens that provided viewers with a realistic sense of depth. Four of them were in suspension mode, displaying the Drifter Races' logo - a mirrored D followed by an R, both blended in such fashion that they seemed but one unusual symbol - while the two holoscreens closest to the improvised entrance displayed a dark-blue background with silver lettered options, the start menu of Drifter Races.
You rushed to the first armchair and sat down. Haji quickly followed, sitting on the other.
Brent walked towards the far end of the chamber and let the weariness of a tiresome day sink him into the chair behind his desk. After rubbing his eyes with one hand, he put on the neuroglove and activated the desk holoprojector atop the desk.
'Link yourselves to the psysis and dive into the dream world,' he said.
Sitting on the armchair, you placed the mesh-shaped device on your head and laid back, the armchair reclining into a prone position. You closed your eyes, your lips bearing a smile, and cleared your mind, allowing the dark quietness to lull you into a dreamless trance.
'Have a nice dream,' you heard Brent's voice in the distance.
Your emptied mind was soon lit by flashes of blurred images and garbled sounds; they came in increasing waves which began flowing like a smooth stream of water. Upon its surface, you saw the clear reflection of the game's options menu, with several options written in psychedelic-blue letters that floated freely over the water.
Amidst the silent dream, you heard the host, 'Establishing an uplink, please hold.'

Sitting behind his desk, Brent attempted to find the safest route for the uplink, steering his hand through the endless stream of data projected above his desk. He rushed along the floating green lines with unflinching concentration, dodging and avoiding every red cube before his path, letting experience guide his almost unconscious gestures with all the precision required for a flawless flight through the digital itinerary.
'This one looks safe,' he muttered to himself, pointing the index finger at a blue cube. 'Now, just a few override protocols and it's done.' 
When he spread his fingers above the highlighted cube, it opened, exposing lines and lines of data impressed on each of the inner faces. He pointed to the face corresponding to the information packets sent to Mother and added a line that would bypass the protocols of the uplink with an override protocol containing uninteresting information. 
'Through the duration of the race we shall be most enthusiastically delving into the records of past geothermal activity in the Sea of Tranquility. Nothing suspicious about it, nothing illegal,' he said to himself.

Alone in your dream, you configured the game options through a sub-menu filled with several parameters, touching the virtual icons with one finger as though the dream had become a palpable reality where any object could be manipulated. Once the hostess confirmed that the uplink was established, you eagerly connected to the game server. 
'Commencing translocation,' said the host.
The configurations menu evaporated in front of you, and you fell at an increasingly higher speed towards what seemed to be the upper view of a giant pavilion floating in dark space. It loomed and loomed ever closer, until you flew right through the ceiling and landed abruptly on a small blue pad inside a vast white hall. 
You got on your feet, shook your head, and saw that you had arrived at the crowded Game Hall of the racetrack. On the walls to your left and right were the tunnels that extended to the pits. At the end of the hall was the long check-in counter, and right behind it, was a window-wall with a view to the racetrack.
Haji was at your side on the spawning pad, clenching and loosening his fists and cracking his neck, left to right. You recognized him immediately, although his face was not his own. Inside the dream world, every user was able to customize his or her appearance through different criteria such as height, weight, hair, voice and even the color and style of their race suits. It was since the very first drifter race that Haji chose to assume the shape of a short and chubby old pyrean, with plump cheeks and long gray hair. Though his was the shortest of all avatars in the drifter races, his limbs were so brawny that they had earned him the respect of every player, which was of great importance, for brawling was not an uncommon outcome whenever there was a misunderstanding between competitors.
'Sturdy as ever,' he said looking at you, and his voice was as warm as his smile.
Your avatar had a youthful look, tall and athletic with a fair noble countenance. Standing next to you, Haji was no higher than your hips. The two of you formed such a unique combination that you were easily recognizable to all your opponents. Rogli and Wogli were your aliases - yours being the first - and given that you were the only darmians playing the game, they were uttered with both humor and respect.
'Let's check-in,' you said and stepped down from the spawning pad.
Haji nodded and followed you.

Only one team of players remained in the Game Hall, and they stood amongst the crowd, seeming to be engaged in a heated discussion with four rowdy spectators concerning a lost bet. Gastians were lively people, and they seemed to find pleasure in engaging in silly competitions regarding just about anything that crossed their restless minds, and they took bets very seriously. By the angry look on the spectator's faces, it was evident that their patience was coming to an end. When the two beleaguered players saw you, they found the perfect chance to leave with their pride - and their avatars - intact. As you walked past them, they greeted you cheerfully, briefly followed you, and then made a discrete run for the tunnel.
When you approached the counter to check-in for the race, the two tall game administrators standing behind it briefly halted their discussion on which of their avatars could wipe their nose with their toes. As soon as they confirmed your aliases, they pointed to the tunnel that led to your pit and resumed arguing without as much of a glance towards you. 
'I'm tellin' ya I can do it!' the one on the left insisted, bouncing on one foot and pushing the other with both his hands.
Just as you stepped away from the counter, Brent's face popped up on the upper left corner of your Field of View .
'All done on this side. The connection is untraceable, and the override protocols are in place,' he said. 'I will be performing the maintenance I scheduled to avoid suspicion. Enjoy the race! I will be back once I am finished. Brent, away,' and his face popped out of sight.

Walking down the tunnel's bright blue rug, you could hear through every pressurized door the muffled sounds of drifters being powered up, the rattling of power drills, wrenches hammering on the ground and voices yelling at each other. Approaching the end of the corridor, you found your pit: ''Rogli&Wogli - Darmian Duo'' was written in neon letters on a blue sign next to the metallic door.
The sliding door opened with a sharp hiss, releasing into the corridor a warm concoction of burnt fuel and sweat that had accumulated in the pit. You took a deep breath and allowed the stimulating smell to fill your lungs. 
'Ahh...the addictive smell of fun,' you said to Haji, grinning wide.
Then you rocketed towards your drifter, snatching the first neuroglove from atop a red tool cabinet, and pressing the drifter's canopy button. After it opened, you jumped into the cramped cabin, whose interior was automatically lit by small cockpit lights. Lying in the ergonomic seat, you put on the neuroglove and began calibrating the drifter to meet the racetrack specifications.
Haji entered the pit calmly, with short chubby steps, his boots glistening with the ceiling projector and clanging on the metallic floor as he walked past your drifter and stopped before his. The drifter resembled a projectile with a large propulsion reactor in the back. Bulging just before its tip and nozzle, were two ring-shaped rudders that allowed the pilot to steer it. 
Quietly admiring its plain design, Haji began setting up his drifter without the use of a neuroglove. It was a delicate task that required a tremendous abstraction from oneself, something you were not particularly good at, but Haji had become exceptionally proficient in interacting directly with dream worlds and using thoughts to alter them.
Sitting inside your cockpit, you continued calibrating yours.
'Last race we did relatively well,' you said. 'Up until the part I flew against Tzivo.'
'That was some explosion,' you heard Haji answer. 'We definitely need to defend our approaches to avoid elimination, if you are truly intent on reaching the top three this year.'
 'Defending approaches would surely work against most teams, but not against Zig and Drom. They are just too good,' you said and sighed aloud, struggling to remember the rear ring-rudder calibration. 
Haji's face popped up above your cockpit, his eyes glinting mischievously. 'If we are unable to avoid those two, I suggest we eliminate them.'
You stopped fumbling the neuroglove through the air and looked up at him, brows furrowed in doubt.
'Are you suggesting we race for elimination?' you asked.
'We most certainly will not,' Haji promptly replied. 'We will remain true to our principles and play for a clean victory. But I have a plan to turn their game against them. I want you to upgrade your drifter with reverse thrusters, and when I give you a signal, I want you to activate them.'
You contemplated his suggestion for a moment. 'You and your strategies,' you answered unconcernedly; then you accessed the drifter settings and clicked on the reverse thrusters upgrade. 'Very well, you've never let us down before.'
The countdown blinked and beeped on a timer above the wide access gate. Simultaneously, a game administrator calmly warned, his voice coming from a speaker next to the timer: 
''Everyone, get inside your drifters. Opening gates in one minute.'' Then the voice shouted before being cut off, ''I'm tellin' ya I can place my feet behind my head and still manage t'a---''
Haji put his plump fingers in his gloves and his electric-blue helmet on his grey haired head, 'Enjoy the race,' he said before leaping into his drifter.
'You too,' you said.
You threw the neuroglove away, put on your helmet, and after the opaque canopy sealed you inside your drifter, pressurizing the interior with a soft whistle, the darkened cockpit slowly started to disappear, save for the handlebars and gauges. It soon became practically invisible, enabling you to see the pit all around it. Lying on the translucent seat, you looked down and felt you were floating above the metallic floor half a meter below.
After the pit was depressurized, the gate started to open. As it slowly rose to the ceiling, it unveiled a dark metallic pavement with two parallel orange arrows flashing above it.
You powered up your drifter's engine. It burned through the first injection of liquid fuel and you felt its thrust pull your body against the prone seat. The pavement slid below you, as you smoothly floated into the pit-lane. Looking to your right, you saw Haji's electric-blue drifter hovering alongside yours.

When you cleared your pit-lane and entered the starting line, you were amazed by the spectacular view. Scattered throughout the dark background were galaxies of all sizes and shapes, and countless stars of white, yellow and red. The track itself orbited around a star system, a colossal blue giant orbited both near and far by gaseous planets whose gravities had ensnared countless asteroids, round and lumpy. For every Championship and every track, the backgrounds were re-customized and re-rendered, and you never ceased to be amazed by the endless variety of cosmic sights. This was one of the best you had seen.
''Race begins in five minutes,'' warned the admin's voice, stealing you from your awe.
The glare from the red starting-lights hurt your eyes as you stopped on the already filled starting-grid and studied the positions. On the qualifying session the week before, you had managed to achieve the third position, while Haji achieved the fifth; had there not been a sudden connection failure and you were confident that you would have done better. Your heart pounded heavily when ten pairs of magnetic locks emerged from the dark metallic pavement, firmly clamping the drifters to their respective positions. 
Jets of burning fuel roared from the drifter's exhausts, clouding the space with plumes of red and blue.
