First memory - Accounts of a remote past

'Wake up, apprentice Alan!' yelled mentor Levine.
You flinched on your chair and opened your eyes. The feeling that you were in trouble quickly roused you to a state of full awareness. Glancing from one side to the other, you found her straight ahead, sitting behind her desk above the dais. Eyes locked on her sharp stare, you sat up straight and calmly placed your hands on your desk.
'Given that you are such an expert on this topic that you need not stay awake, you shall clarify for us the first details pertaining to the beginning of the Age of Obscurity,' she said.
From the silence that followed, you could hear the whisperings of some of your fellow apprentices complaining about the interruption.
The mentor placed her forearms on her plain metal desk, clasped her hands and beckoned firmly, 'Apprentice Balthazar, time does not stand still,' she said, this time employing your surname, as was formally required.
...Alan Balthazar...that was my name...
You gave her a defiant stare, and above the whisperings, you calmly asked, 'The official account or the truth?'
The indoctrination room was instantly immersed in a dumbfounded silence as every apprentice straightened in their chairs and looked directly ahead.
The mentor rose from her seat, staring at you gravely. 'Be very cautious in choosing your next words apprentice Balthazar, for if they are not what I expect to hear I shall personally escort you to a group of Overseers.'
You hid your uneasiness under a calm expression, knowing you had gone too far. You would not dare challenge her any further, for you had experience of how disturbing a session with Council Overseers could be: strenuous hours of interrogation followed by a long wait for the results, but worst of all, their subversive speech which seemed more like a subliminal way of compelling you to obedience rather than a simple reprimand.
'My apologies, mentor Levine,' you answered, a sober look on your face. 'It was not my intention to show disrespect.'
The mentor did not react immediately. During the uncomfortable silence that followed she merely gave you a dull stare.
'Apology accepted, apprentice Balthazar,' she then mumbled with indifference.
Slowly and wearily, she sat back on her chair and resumed the indoctrination as though nothing had happened, continuing to address the circumstances that led to the extinction of the Antiga Pyre:
'With the analysis of recently discovered artifacts, it has become clear to us that the collapse of antigan civilization is related to the emergence of the retrovirus PIn-T2. This retrovirus was incurable and highly contagious, and in many cases, it would not terminate the existence of its host, earning it the title of the Torment. Due to these characteristics, it rapidly spread throughout antigan societies and destroyed them from within, either by infecting their inhabitants or by forcing them to flee,' she said and stopped to take a sip of water from the cup on top of the desk, only to continue at the monotonous pace of her ever-parching lips. 'Archaeological evidence further suggests that the end of the Age of the Antiga Pyre was marked by the antigan's last effort to contain the pandemic with the construction of self-sustained safe-havens. Despite ensuring the safety of their residents, these save-havens proved to be unsuccessful in stemming the continuous invasions of infected pyreans without terminating their existence, and in the centuries of genocide that followed, the Antiga Pyre slipped to the brink of self-extinction.'
As you waited for the end of the indoctrination. you struggled to focus your attention on her less than plump face and short gray hair, yet, from time to time, you could not resist looking outside the window-wall behind her. The sky was a pale shade of orange, the sign that Mithras was setting, and the indoctrination was soon ending. You were anxious for that moment, for you and Haji had planned to spend the rest of the afternoon at the Shelter.
Haji, however, was paying due attention, sitting at the desk next to yours and listening to every word the mentor spoke. When she busied herself for a moment to prepare the next holographic projection, he gave you a sympathetic smile to demonstrate his solidarity. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you threw him a wicked grin.
A three-dimensional projection of Artica highlighting the last pockets of antigan civilization appeared above the holoprojector, a large bowl-shaped device the length of a pyrean that was placed on the center of the days.
'There are few recovered artifacts of the subsequent Age of Obscurity,' mentor Levine continued, 'nevertheless, these allowed us to determine that the save-havens were eventually exposed to the virus and their inhabitants infected. During the following millennia, the remaining antigans scattered throughout Artica, some adopting a nomadic form of existence, others constructing small crude encampments that were presumably unable to grow beyond haphazard settlements. It was during these six thousand years of obscurity that the legacy of the antigan civilization was lost and the genetic mutation caused by the retrovirus settled into the gene pool of the Pyre as it was carried on from generation to generation, unchecked, unhindered. Ultimately, this mutation led the last survivors of the Antiga Pyre to evolve into a new species, we, the Nova Pyre,' mentor Levine stated, her dull voice hindering your task of answering the feedback questions that were being continuously sent to your neuropad .
'The Age of Obscurity was a time of ignorance and savagery, but it was during that time, and in such inhospitable conditions, that a pyrean rose up and rescued the Pyre from its slow but inevitable self-extinction. After decades of isolation on the most ancient and reclusive laboratory of the Nova Pyre, our illustrious Guiding Father conceived a device capable of suppressing our genetic flaw. It was then, that in his great wisdom, he created the Personal Identification Unit, thus putting an end to the Age of Obscurity. It was then, that he became the Savior of the Pyre,' she said and became silent, casting her droopy eyes upon each of the apprentices.
A murmur spread throughout the room as a few apprentices began murmuring amongst themselves, some pointing, others staring at their left forearms. Because she was pleased with their suspicion, mentor Levine expressed her only smile throughout the entire year. It was but a thin bent line on her lips, yet given it was coming from her, it was as big of a display of joy as laughing.
'Precisely,' she resumed with a withered enthusiasm, 'the thin, transparent membrane bound to your left forearm is far more extraordinary than it appears to be. Despite its apparent simplicity, it represents the ingenuity of the Pyre in overcoming the retrovirus that put an end to our ancestors, and it is one of the two core technologies that ensure the functionality of our prototype metropolis. The Unit, as it is commonly referred to, is not only capable of regulating and monitoring our vital functions, but also of blocking the genetic flaw caused by the retrovirus.' Pausing for a moment to recover her breath, she drank the last sip of water from the cup and resumed. 'The second core technology of Darm and the second most important achievement of our Guiding Father, is the sentient artificial intelligence that maintains order in our metropolis. She resides in the Netcore, and readily performs the invaluable and interminable task of monitoring and processing all the activities performed by every citizen and apprentice in Darm, an exemplary performance which has awarded her the title of Mother. In sum, it is only because of these two technologies that the Nova Pyre was allowed to build a sustainable and prosperous metropolis, without ignorance or savagery, without quarrel or idleness, and most important of all, free from the affliction that put an end to the Antiga Pyre more than six thousand years ago. It is a brilliant accomplishment, one that has rescued us from the Age of Obscurity and brought us to a new age, the Age of Enlightenment,' she said, her stare shifting from apprentice to apprentice and finally resting on you.
With some difficulty, you restrained your desire to reply with a statement that would certainly condemn you to spend the rest of the afternoon in an interrogation room. Instead, you gently smiled at her, and when her stare was no longer upon you, you expelled your impatience through your nostrils.
Not long after, there was the short notice coming from your Unit, announcing the end of the indoctrination. The window-wall behind the mentor darkened and the side walls of the room were lit with long lists of names, the Standings of the one thousand Level Ten apprentices. Before granting permission to stand and leave, mentor Levine, herself standing next to the holoprojector, announced:
'For the next indoctrination, I shall begin the last topic of the year: a modern approach to the impact of the Torment in the surviving populations scattered across Artica. I remind you once more, that fifty Credits are awarded to those who productively prepare and present it. Therefore, those of you who are intent on achieving this year's Highest Distinction award shall do well in preparing these final indoctrinations.'
From amongst the names and corresponding Standings on the walls, fifty were highlighted in front of their respective number. You looked with indifference at your name in front of the number eight hundred.
'According to the current Standings, apprentice Sophie Andersen, standing on the twenty-seventh, holds the highest standing of this class, followed by apprentice Heidi Lauren on the forty-sixth and apprentice Haji Donovan in the sixty-fourth. The lowest Standings would do well to seek advice from these bright apprentices,' she said, glancing at you and some other apprentices who lowered their heads with embarrassment.
She then nodded to the class, granting permission to stand up and leave.
You had barely risen from the chair when she added, 'Apprentice Balthazar, do refrain from leaving your seat.'
