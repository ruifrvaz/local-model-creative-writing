Second memory - Nightfall at the White Metropolis

[...] and the Academy for Indoctrination and Preparation for Citizenship. These shall be the four facilities surrounding the Netcore, the primary structure of the metropolis. An ideal cylinder in shape and with a surface made entirely of a reflective composite, the Netcore shall reside atop the Central Circle and shall surpass in height and splendor any other structure ever built by the Pyre, rising above the storms as a symbol of our perseverance. Extending from the Central Circle along the cardinal directions, the Four Boulevards will stretch out to the Four Magnetization Towers. These structures shall emit a resonant magnetic field capable of levitating personal and public transports and providing free energy to any device inside the metropolis. Periodically installed along the rims of the Boulevards, there shall be spacious floating platforms which will lift its inhabitants to the Panoramic Way. Spanning across the metropolis directly above the Four Boulevards, the Panoramic Way shall provide an alternative means of transportation. In conclusion, these will be the primary constructs of the prototype metropolis, and they shall serve its inhabitants so that they may perform their duties in an efficient manner.

An excerpt from annex #21: Directives for the construction of Darm;
Division of Urban Planning under the authority of Mentalist Torval;


Outside the hallway, Mithras, the star that shone upon Artica and warmed its frozen crust, had already hidden behind the tall and imposing buildings of the Specialist Class Sector, engulfing the Academy in a fresh shadow. You and Haji rushed down the stairs and quickly crossed the main courtyard, adorned at the center by a fountain with a white marble statue of the Guiding Father.
Upon entering the East Boulevard, you hastily weaved your way through the aligned flow of citizens as orderly as you could, climbing afterwards onto the nearest floating platform whose entrance remained perpetually guarded by two sentinels .
The warm maternal voice of Mother spoke in your mind: ''Access to platform number two authenticated and granted. Have a pleasant Rest Time, apprentice Balthazar.''
'I intend to,' you whispered to yourself as you stopped next to Haji in the back row of citizens.
The platform reached its maximum quota slowly, as citizens and apprentices returned from their tasks. By the look on some of their tired faces, they were headed to their residences to find some well needed rest.
'Return hour...' you complained impatiently to Haji.
Haji nodded, smiling afterwards to the citizen next of him, who glanced back with absent eyes. Shortly after, the ascent was announced by the uncoupling of the magnetic locks that held the floating platform one step above the ground.

Five hundred meters above, you and Haji boarded a Panoramic Transport and took your seats. Apart from the flooring and the seats, which were made of a metal so polished that mirrored every passenger, the rest of the structure was made of permaglass , allowing for a panoramic view of Darm. Far to the East, beyond the countless blocks of residences and the Coastal Walkway, was the Sea of Tranquility.
'Sophie is really interested in you,' you said, sitting next to Haji on an aisle seat.
Sitting in a window seat and looking outside, Haji turned his attention to you and asked with enthusiasm, 'Are you for certain?'
You gave him a confused stare, 'Well...yes. She was practically speechless after you told her you would never do anything that would drive you apart,' you quoted amusedly. 'And did you see the way she blushed?'
'Yes, I did,' he said. 'But it seemed like a normal reaction, given the circumstances.'
'A normal reaction?!' you asked, eyes widened in surprise. 'I can't understand how you see it that way.'
Haji stared at is boots while reviewing every nuance of her reaction, every detail of her bashful gestures, her sparkling eyes, her coy smile, her mellifluous voice. 
He sighed, 'It is hard to read her mind.'
'Haji, trust me. She likes you, for certain,' you teased, grinning afterwards.
When you arrived at the Administrator Class Sector, you and Haji disembarked with many of the remaining passengers and entered the Sixth Platform. As it descended, you saw through the transparent floor the dense blocks of residences gradually grow under your feet. Darm was enduring the last weeks of the freezing winter of Artica, and the unrelenting snowstorms were still evident in the mantles of snow accumulated on the streets, water fountains and rooftops.
Arriving at ground level, you and Haji stepped onto the street with hasty footsteps, and after a short walk you arrived at the crossroads that connected your streets.
'The first one to arrive at the meeting point waits for the other,' Haji reminded you. 'Don't do anything foolish, troublemaker.'
'I will try not to, edgy,' you quickly riposted, and as he turned to his street you turned to yours.

...what was the meaning of these names...
After breaking so many of Darm's Directives, you gave each other nicknames. Haji was the first to adopt them ten years before this time, after an act of insurgence at the Academy where you attempted to instigate your fellow apprentices to skip indoctrinations. Haji was the only one to support you, and for that, both of you were deprived of Rest Day for the rest of the year. He never blamed you for it, and he never left your side afterwards, regardless of all the trouble you got him into. It was long ago that the bonds of your friendship were first forged.
...Haji...who are you...

Before he could head for the Shelter, Haji had to deceive Mother by taking his routine path back to his residence. Mother was not only capable of accurately pinpointing the location of any darmian through the signal each Unit emitted, but also of determining if that location was valid for their occupation. As an Apprentice, a journey to the Manufacturing Sector during Rest Time would be promptly characterized as an inappropriate conduit.
As he walked down the sidewalk, crunching the layer of snow resting on top of the marble pavement, he remembered the day when the Shelter's owner gave him the program capable of eluding Her, and how he was able to re-route his Unit's signal by installing the program on his residence's terminal and use it as a bridge between his Unit and Mother. As a result, every time he activated the program, he was free to travel to any place in Darm, while Mother saw him as simply an exhausted darmian lying on his bed.
When he arrived at his residence, he greeted his caretakers, who were sitting on the comfortable sofa of the living room, and explained he was going out and was arriving late due to a meeting with his friends, while carefully omitting where he was going next. After walking up the stairs to his room to activate the Signal Re-Route, he bowed to his caretakers and left quickly, seeming to his caretakers that he had only come to retrieve something he needed.
He then returned to the streets, trudging along the cold snowy pavement, his hands tucked in the jacket's pockets, his face hidden behind his facemask while his head tilted low beneath the green hood. He avoided proximity with other passersby, always keeping in mind he could not risk being identified.

...this was no memory of mine...
It was not. All life is bound to the Tides of Fate, and as we flow through it, we are free to see the course of events through the viewpoint of any life. It was your desire to see Haji that brought upon you a thread of his past.
...then I can control these visions...
You can, but only because your will is strong. However, you must take caution, for the journey through the Tides of Fate is not without peril to the reckless traveler. Its currents are treacherous, and if your will falters, you may lose hold over them and become trapped inside the memories of another. It is best that you let me guide you.
