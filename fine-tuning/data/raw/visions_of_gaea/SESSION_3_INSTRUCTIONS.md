## Pre-Session Analysis

### Known Scene Structure

**Opening (lines 989-996):**
- Framing quote about transportation technology
- Sets up hoverboard as personal transport device

**Morning Routine (lines 997-1018):**
- Alan wakes up (sleep antagonists released by Unit)
- Evander's cheerful morning greeting
- Hampy on the bed
- Alan rushes to get dressed
- Decides to take hoverboard instead of panoramic transport
- Haji warns him via thought connection about crowded hoverlanes

**Weather Description (line 1019-1020):**
- Clear blue sky, no clouds
- Snow melting from night's accumulation

**Unknown (lines 1021-1132):**
- Hoverboard journey (likely ~4,400 words)
- Possible encounters, obstacles, or worldbuilding
- Arrival at destination or transition to next scene

### Estimated Chunking Strategy

**Preliminary Plan (subject to revision during session):**

1. **Chunk 020:** Morning routine + hoverboard departure (lines 989-1040, est. 1,200-1,500 words)
2. **Chunk 021:** Hoverboard journey part 1 (lines 1041-1070, est. 1,500-1,800 words)
3. **Chunk 022:** Hoverboard journey part 2 (lines 1071-1100, est. 1,500-1,800 words)
4. **Chunk 023:** Journey conclusion + arrival (lines 1101-1132, est. 1,000-1,500 words)

**Note:** Actual chunk boundaries will be determined by scene breaks, location changes, and narrative flow during the session.

## Chunking Guidelines for Session 3

### Word Count Targets

- **Minimum:** 800 words
- **Target Range:** 1,200-1,500 words (ideal)
- **Maximum Acceptable:** 2,500 words (for complex action sequences)
- **Oversized Threshold:** 3,000+ words (split if possible)

### Break Point Priority (Session 3 Specific)

1. **Scene breaks** (*** markers, blank lines with narrative shift)
2. **Location changes** (residence → hoverlanes → Academy)
3. **Tonal shifts** (introspection → action → worldbuilding)
4. **Time markers** (morning routine → journey progression)
5. **Narrative pauses** (natural cliffhangers, decision points)

### Quality Requirements

✅ **Complete narrative units:** No mid-action splits
✅ **POV consistency:** Maintain second-person perspective
✅ **Context preservation:** Include character motivations and setting details
✅ **Dialogue integrity:** Keep exchanges complete
✅ **Worldbuilding terms:** First mentions need context (hoverboard mechanics, hoverlanes, etc.)

---

## Expected Challenges

### Potential Issues

⚠️ **Long continuous action sequence**
- Hoverboard ride may be 4,000+ words without clear breaks
- **Solution:** Look for natural pauses (obstacles, encounters, decisions)
- Split at tonal shifts (speed → caution, excitement → reflection)

⚠️ **Technical worldbuilding exposition**
- Framing quote discusses quantum teleportation and transportation tech
- **Solution:** Keep with related narrative content (hoverboard scene)

⚠️ **Pacing variation**
- Morning routine is slower (character moment)
- Hoverboard ride likely fast-paced (action)
- **Solution:** Chunk boundaries at pace transitions

### Session-Specific Considerations

**Hoverboard mechanics:**
- May include technical descriptions of hoverlane navigation
- Speed, altitude, traffic rules
- Alan's skill level and rule-breaking tendencies

**Darm cityscape:**
- Worldbuilding opportunity (urban layout, architecture)
- Transportation infrastructure (hoverlanes, glider paths)
- Mithras (sun) descriptions, weather effects on snow/ice

**Character state:**
- Alan is excited for the Gathering
- Potential for reckless behavior (Haji's warning about traffic)
- Morning optimism vs. underlying anxieties about citizenship

## File Naming Convention

### Chunk Files

**Pattern:** `chunk_0XX_ch09_descriptive_name.txt`

**Examples:**
- `chunk_020_ch09_morning_hoverboard_departure.txt`
- `chunk_021_ch09_hoverlane_journey_pt1.txt`
- `chunk_022_ch09_hoverlane_journey_pt2.txt`
- `chunk_023_ch09_academy_arrival.txt`

**Naming Guidelines:**
- `0XX` = sequential number (020, 021, 022, 023...)
- `ch09` = Memory 9 identifier
- `descriptive_name` = brief scene/content identifier (no spaces, underscores only)

---

## Workflow for Session 3

### Step 1: Detailed Analysis (15-20 minutes)

```
1. Read lines 989-1132 completely
2. Identify all natural break points:
   - Scene breaks (*** markers)
   - Location changes
   - Tonal/pacing shifts
   - Time markers
3. Map out scene structure
4. Calculate word counts for potential chunk boundaries
5. Verify no segment < 800 words or > 3,000 words
```

### Step 2: Chunking Execution (30-40 minutes)

```
1. Create chunk files sequentially (020, 021, 022...)
2. Use sed -n 'START,ENDp' to extract line ranges
3. Verify each chunk:
   - Complete narrative unit
   - Proper word count
   - No orphaned references
   - Context sufficient for standalone reading
4. Double-check sequential numbering
```

### Step 3: Validation (10-15 minutes)

```
1. Count words in each chunk (wc -w)
2. Verify total words match source (5,735 words)
3. Check filename conventions
4. Spot-check narrative coherence (read first/last paragraphs)
5. Flag any concerns for manual review
```

### Step 4: Reporting (15-20 minutes)

```
1. Update SESSION_3_REPORT.md:
   - List chunks with word counts
   - Total words chunked
   - Quality checks
   - Summary of Memory 9 content
2. Create SESSION_4_INSTRUCTIONS.md:
   - Scope: Memory 10 "The Gathering" (~11,245 words)
   - Expected chunks: 6-8
   - Special considerations for large memory
```

## Next Memory Preview (Session 4)

### Memory 10: The Gathering

**Estimated Stats:**
- **Lines:** 1133-1455 (323 lines)
- **Estimated Words:** ~11,245 words
- **Expected Chunks:** 6-8 chunks
- **Complexity:** Very high (major story event)

**Content Preview:**
- The Gathering ceremony (finalists choose companions)
- Animal costume presentations
- Alan's Ailuropoda melanoleuca (panda) presentation
- Social interactions, romantic tensions
- Likely climax or turning point for multiple character arcs

**Session 4 Planning Notes:**
- Large memory will require careful chunking
- High dialogue content (presentations, social interactions)
- Multiple character POV moments (though narrated through Alan)
- Emotionally significant scenes (Cathy subplot, Haji/Sophie relationship)
- May need 7-8 chunks to properly segment

## Command Reference for Session 3

### Extract Line Ranges (Example)

```bash
# Navigate to working directory
cd /home/runner/work/local-model-creative-writing/local-model-creative-writing/fine-tuning/data/raw/visions_of_gaea

# Extract chunk (example: lines 989-1040)
sed -n '989,1040p' ascension_part_1_manuscript.txt > chunk_020_ch09_morning_hoverboard_departure.txt

# Count words in chunk
wc -w chunk_020_ch09_morning_hoverboard_departure.txt

# Verify all Session 3 chunks
for f in chunk_02{0..3}_*.txt; do echo "$f: $(wc -w < "$f") words"; done
```

### Calculate Total Words

```bash
# Count words in specific line range
sed -n '989,1132p' ascension_part_1_manuscript.txt | wc -w

# Sum all Session 3 chunk word counts
echo "Total words in Session 3: $(($(wc -w < chunk_020_*.txt) + $(wc -w < chunk_021_*.txt) + ...))"
```

## Important Notes

### Maintain Consistency

- **Naming convention:** chunk_0XX_ch09_description.txt
- **Line numbering:** Track source line ranges accurately
- **Sequential order:** chunk_020, chunk_021, chunk_022, chunk_023...
- **Report format:** Match SESSION_1_REPORT.md and SESSION_2_REPORT.md structure

### Quality Over Speed

- **Prioritize narrative coherence** over hitting exact word count targets
- **Preserve author's voice** and pacing choices
- **Flag concerns** rather than making forced splits
- **Document decisions** in SESSION_3_REPORT.md

### Session 3 Special Focus

- **Action sequence chunking:** Hoverboard ride likely contains fast-paced action
- **Worldbuilding integration:** Transportation technology descriptions
- **Character state:** Alan's excitement and recklessness
- **Setting details:** Darm cityscape, weather, urban infrastructure
