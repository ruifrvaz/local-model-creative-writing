Dr. Kenji Yamamoto stared at the quantum field equations and tried to ignore the voice in his head telling him they'd made a fundamental mistake.

The Alcubierre drive worked. Three successful FTL jumps proved that. But the degradation patterns suggested something wrong with the underlying physics.

Or something right that they'd misunderstood.

He pulled up the field topology from the last jump. The spacetime bubble had formed correctly—compressed space ahead of the ship, expanded space behind. Created a wave that the ship rode faster than light.

But the bubble's geometry wasn't smooth. Micro-fractures appeared at the interface between compressed and normal space. Like cracks in glass under stress.

"Still here?" Admiral Kowalski appeared in the engineering bay doorway.

"Still trying to understand why our drive is eating itself." Kenji zoomed in on the fracture patterns. "We're missing something. Some factor in the equations that accounts for field stability."

"Military wants results, not perfect theory."

"Military wants a drive that works more than nine times." Kenji pulled up his revised calculations. "I think the problem is energy distribution. We're creating the Alcubierre field with focused graviton beams, but the energy density is too high at the focus points. That's where we're seeing fractures."

"Can you redistribute the energy?"

"Maybe. If I modify the beam geometry." Kenji started sketching configurations. "Instead of six focal points, we use twelve. Spreads the load, reduces stress concentration."

"Will it work?"

"Won't know until we test it."

Kowalski studied the designs. "How long to implement?"

"Forty-eight hours. Maybe sixty if we run into complications."

"You have forty. I want this ready for the next jump cycle."

Kenji wanted to argue. But Kowalski was already gone. The admiral lived in a world of schedules and political pressure. Kenji lived in a world of physics and consequences.

He pulled up the engineering team roster and started assigning tasks. Reconfigure the graviton emitters. Modify the field control algorithms. Test everything before installation.

And hope the math was right.

Twenty hours in, Dr. Aisha Mbara found him half-asleep over the workstation.

"You're going to give yourself a stroke," she said.

"That's what coffee is for." Kenji gestured at the empty cups littering his workspace.

Aisha pulled up a chair. "I reviewed Sarah's medical data. She's showing cellular damage from the jumps. Neurological stress markers, temporal displacement syndrome, early signs of quantum entanglement effects at the cellular level."

"Entanglement effects? That's not possible."

"It's happening anyway. Her cells are showing quantum correlation with their past states. Like they remember being in the other location."

Kenji felt ice run through his veins. "That's... that shouldn't be possible. Quantum decoherence happens too fast at biological temperatures."

"Should and is are apparently different things when you're traveling faster than light." Aisha pulled up the cellular analysis. "She's literally carrying quantum information from the jump start point. Her body exists in a superposition of states."

"For how long?"

"The correlation decays over forty-eight hours. But each jump reinforces it. She's building up quantum resonance."

"What happens if it doesn't decay?"

"I don't know. Nobody's ever studied this. But I'm worried we're altering her at a fundamental level."

Kenji thought about the drive's degradation. The field fractures. The way spacetime seemed to resist being manipulated.

"What if it's not just Sarah?" he said. "What if the drive itself is experiencing quantum entanglement with previous jump states?"

Aisha blinked. "You're saying the drive remembers where it's been?"

"Not remembers. But maintains quantum correlation with its past configurations. Each jump creates interference patterns with the previous ones. That could explain the fractures—the field is fighting itself, trying to exist in states that are quantum-correlated but spatially separated."

"That's terrifying."

"That's physics." Kenji pulled up the drive's quantum state data. "If I'm right, we need to implement quantum error correction. Break the correlation between jumps."

"How?"

"No idea. Nobody's invented quantum error correction for Alcubierre drives because nobody thought we'd need it."

They sat in silence, contemplating the problem. FTL travel worked. But it created quantum entanglement across light-years. The drive carried ghosts of its previous states. And so did the pilot.

"We need to tell Kowalski," Aisha said.

"Tell him what? That his drive is haunted by quantum mechanics? That we don't know how to fix it?"

"Tell him we're hurting Sarah. That each jump is building up quantum resonance that might not decay."

Kenji looked at the modified field configuration he'd been designing. Twelve focal points instead of six. It would reduce stress. But it wouldn't solve the quantum entanglement problem.

Nothing would. Except maybe stopping the jumps entirely.

"I'll talk to him," Kenji said.

He found Kowalski in the observation deck, watching the stars. The admiral looked older than his years. Carrying the weight of a project that could change humanity's future or kill everyone aboard trying.

"Sir. We have a problem."

Kenji laid out the quantum entanglement data. The cellular damage in Sarah. The drive's degradation patterns. The possibility that each jump was creating quantum correlations that compounded over time.

Kowalski absorbed it without comment. Then: "Recommendations?"

"Halt the test program. Implement quantum error correction if we can figure out how. Redesign the drive to minimize entanglement effects."

"Timeline?"

"Months. Maybe years."

"We don't have months." Kowalski pulled up a classified file. "Earth's political situation is deteriorating. Multiple factions want FTL capability. If we don't prove it works, someone else will try. Probably with less caution than we're using."

"That's not a reason to kill our test pilot."

"It's a reason to get this right before someone else gets it wrong." Kowalski closed the file. "I appreciate your concern for Lieutenant Chen. But she's a volunteer. She knows the risks."

"Does she know her cells are quantum-entangled with locations twelve light-years away?"

"No. Because you're going to figure out how to fix that." Kowalski met his eyes. "You've got the smartest physics team in the system, Dr. Yamamoto. Find a solution. Because we're not stopping."

Kenji wanted to argue. But Kowalski was right about one thing—stopping wouldn't prevent someone else from trying. Better to figure out the problems here, with safety protocols and medical monitoring, than let some military contractor push a crew to destruction chasing results.

"I'll need resources," Kenji said. "Quantum computing time. Access to theoretical physics databases. And I want Sarah Chen on mandatory medical monitoring after every jump."

"Approved. Anything else?"

"Prayer wouldn't hurt."

Kowalski smiled slightly. "Already covered that."

Kenji returned to engineering and assembled his team. Physicists, mathematicians, quantum computing specialists. Everyone who might have insights into quantum error correction for FTL drives.

"We're inventing a new field of physics," he told them. "We have forty hours before the next jump. Figure it out."

They worked through the night. Modeling quantum decoherence rates. Calculating interference patterns. Trying to find a way to break quantum correlations across light-years.

At hour thirty-six, junior physicist Dr. Lee had an idea.

"What if we don't try to break the correlation? What if we use it?"

Kenji looked up from his calculations. "Explain."

"The quantum entanglement creates interference patterns. But interference can be constructive. What if we design the drive to use the entanglement? Make it a feature instead of a bug?"

"You're suggesting we intentionally maintain quantum correlation between jumps."

"Yes. Build it into the field equations. Instead of fighting the entanglement, we navigate using it. The drive would know where it's been because it would still be partially there."

It was insane. It was brilliant. It violated every intuition about how quantum mechanics should work at macroscopic scales.

But the data suggested it might actually be possible.

"Run the simulations," Kenji said.

Twelve hours later, they had a working model. The drive would maintain controlled quantum entanglement between jump points. Navigate using the correlation as a reference frame. Instead of fracturing from quantum interference, it would use the interference to stabilize the field.

Kenji transmitted the proposal to Kowalski.

"Sir, I think we've been approaching this wrong. We need to embrace the quantum weirdness, not fight it."

Kowalski reviewed the simulations. "This is untested theory."

"All of this is untested theory. At least this version has mathematical support."

"And Lieutenant Chen? What happens to her quantum entanglement?"

"She becomes a navigation beacon. Quantum-correlated with every jump point we've hit. It's actually safer—her biology adapts to the entanglement instead of fighting it."

"You're sure?"

"No. But I'm more sure than I was twelve hours ago."

Kowalski was quiet for a long moment. "Implement it. Carefully. And if Sarah Chen shows any adverse effects, we shut down immediately."

Kenji exhaled. "Yes, sir."

They had thirty hours to rewrite physics.

It would have to be enough.
