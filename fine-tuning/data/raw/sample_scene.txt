The bridge doors hissed open before Elena reached them. Marcus stood at the sensor array, his shoulders rigid beneath the standard-issue uniform that never quite fit his frame.

"Show me." She crossed the deck in four strides, her cybernetic arm already reaching for the console controls. The metal caught the emergency lighting—red streaks across polished chrome.

The holographic display flickered to life. Radiation signatures danced across the quantum foam, patterns that shouldn't exist this far from any stellar body. Her pulse quickened. She'd seen readings like this once before. On Phobos.

"How long?" Her voice stayed level despite the cold spreading through her chest.

Marcus glanced at the chronometer. "Seventeen minutes since first detection. It's moving." He zoomed the display, highlighting the trajectory. "Intercept course. ETA four hours at current velocity."

Elena's fingers moved across the interface, pulling up spectral analysis, mass estimates, electromagnetic signatures. Each data point confirmed what she already knew. What she'd hoped never to see again.

"Wake the captain." She straightened, her organic hand clenching briefly before releasing. "And prep the quantum drives. Full power."

"We're in restricted space. If we—"

"I don't care about territorial boundaries." The words came sharp. She softened her tone, just slightly. "This isn't about politics, Marcus. It's about survival."

He nodded once and moved to the comm station. Elena watched the display, the alien signature pulsing steadily closer. Phobos had been a warning. A test, perhaps. Whatever came next would be the real thing.

The stellar bar would have to wait. Along with sleep, and the three days' leave she'd been promised. She'd known it was too good to be true the moment they'd entered the Arcturus Sector.

Behind her, the lift doors opened. Captain Torres stepped onto the bridge, sleep still evident in the set of his jaw. "Report."

Elena gestured to the display. "Unknown contact. Matching energy signatures from the Phobos incident. Range closing, four hours to intercept."

Torres studied the readings in silence. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of twenty years in deep space. "Sound general quarters. Helm, new heading: zero-four-seven mark twelve. Maximum burn."

"Sir?" The helmsman's confusion was audible.

"We're running," Torres said flatly. "Because whatever that is, we're not ready for it."

Elena felt the deck shift beneath her feet as the ship came about. The quantum drives thrummed to life, a subsonic vibration that traveled through deck plates and bones. Running was the smart choice. The only choice.

But she couldn't shake the feeling that running was exactly what it wanted them to do.
