Captain Jax Torres sat in the Lucky Strike's cramped command deck, reading the message that had just come through encrypted channels.

"They know."

Kayla looked up from navigation. "Who knows what?"

"Helios. They know we found something valuable. They're offering to buy our mining rights to asteroid 2847-Delta." Jax pulled up the offer. "Fifty thousand credits. Immediate payment."

"That's insulting. If they're offering fifty thousand, the real value is probably ten times that."

"At least. But it tells us they're watching. Monitoring our operations. Probably have algorithms tracking every independent miner's patterns for signs of valuable finds."

Sofia joined them from the lab. "Do we know how they figured it out?"

"Could be anything. Energy signatures, mining duration, trajectory patterns. Consortium surveillance is sophisticated."

"So what do we do?"

Jax pulled up their options. Accept the offer and walk away with fifty thousand credits. A modest score, enough to repair some equipment, operate for another year.

Or refuse and risk Helios escalating. Legal challenges. Claim jumping. Outright theft masked as corporate acquisition.

"We refuse. But carefully. Make it look like we don't know why they're interested."

"They'll escalate."

"Probably. But we need time to extract the exotic matter before they figure out how to take it legally."

Kayla pulled up the stealth beacon tracking their hidden sample. "Wrench's extractor won't be ready for another week. Can we stay invisible that long?"

"We make ourselves less interesting. Move to different asteroids. Mine standard materials. Act like 2847-Delta was just another stop on our normal route."

Sofia was skeptical. "If they're watching this closely, won't sudden disinterest look suspicious?"

"Maybe. But we're improvising. Same as always."

Jax composed a response to Helios. Polite refusal, citing long-term mining plans for the sector, expressing appreciation for the offer but declining at this time.

The response came back within hours. A second offer. Seventy-five thousand credits.

"They're escalating already," Kayla said.

"Because they know fifty percent increase says we're negotiating. Might reveal how much we think it's worth."

"Do we counter?"

Jax thought about it. "No. We go silent. Stop responding. Act like we're just not interested in selling, period."

Three days later, a Helios legal ship arrived in their sector. The comm officer was professional but with an edge of menace.

"Independent vessel Lucky Strike, this is Helios Legal Affairs Ship Adjudicator. We need to discuss your mining operations in sector seven-seven-delta."

Jax kept his voice neutral. "What about them?"

"Your claim to asteroid 2847-Delta overlaps with a prior Helios survey claim filed six months ago. We're contesting your right to mine that location."

"We filed through proper Belt Authority channels. All claims are registered and verified."

"Nevertheless, we have documentation showing our prior interest. We're initiating claim dispute procedures. Until resolved, all mining operations at 2847-Delta must cease."

There it was. Legal warfare. They couldn't take the asteroid by force, so they'd tie it up in bureaucratic disputes that could last months. Time enough to figure out what the Lucky Strike had found and prepare proper seizure.

"We'll comply with dispute procedures. But our operations continue at other locations."

"Understood. Legal documentation will be transmitted through Belt Authority channels. Adjudicator out."

After the ship departed, Jax pulled up the legal filing. It was thin—barely plausible claim based on survey data from before the Lucky Strike had registered their own claim. But Helios had lawyers and resources to drag the dispute out indefinitely.

"They're boxing us in," Sofia said. "Can't mine the asteroid legally. Can't extract the exotic matter without admitting we found it. Can't walk away without losing everything."

"So we extract it illegally. Before the legal dispute plays out. Before they figure out what we have."

Wrench's voice crackled through from the workshop. "Extractor's almost ready. Four more days. But I need continuous power for the extraction process. Can't run silent while pulling exotic matter."

"How much power?"

"Enough that anyone monitoring our energy signature will know we're doing something unusual."

Kayla pulled up sensor data. "Helios has three ships in this sector now. Increased from normal survey operations. They're watching us."

"Then we need a distraction. Something that pulls their attention away from 2847-Delta long enough for us to extract and run."

"Like what?"

Jax scanned the sector maps. "There. Asteroid 3102-Gamma. High iron content, unusual magnetic properties. If we start mining there aggressively, broadcast that we're excited about the find, Helios might think we've moved on from 2847-Delta."

"Fake enthusiasm about a mediocre asteroid to hide real valuable find?"

"Exactly. We're independent miners. We're supposed to get excited about anything that might pay. Helios expects that behavior."

Sofia started plotting the deception. "I can analyze 3102-Gamma, publish some research showing interesting but not exotic findings. Make it look scientifically intriguing without revealing too much."

"And I'll file new mining claims, maybe even tip off some other independent crews that there's something worth checking out. Create noise around the fake find."

Wrench joined the channel. "While you're distracting Helios, I'll move the extractor to 2847-Delta quietly. Low-power maneuvering, minimal signatures. Set up for rapid extraction the moment they're focused elsewhere."

"Timeline?"

"Need three days to position everything. Another two for actual extraction if we push it."

"Five days total. Can we keep Helios interested in the fake asteroid for five days?"

"Only one way to find out."

They implemented the plan immediately. Jax moved the Lucky Strike to 3102-Gamma, broadcasting mining operations. Sofia published analysis showing unusual but inconclusive mineral properties. Kayla spread rumors through independent miner channels about a potentially valuable find.

Helios took the bait. Their ships shifted focus, monitoring the Lucky Strike's operations at 3102-Gamma. Sensor sweeps, close-range surveillance, the full corporate attention.

Meanwhile, Wrench deployed the extractor to 2847-Delta using minimal-signature thrusters. Set up the equipment in the asteroid's shadow, shielded from direct observation.

"Extractor in position," he reported after three days. "Ready for extraction when you give the word."

Jax checked Helios ship positions. All three vessels were focused on 3102-Gamma. This was their window.

"Do it. Fast and quiet."

The extraction took thirty-seven hours. Wrench worked continuously, pulling exotic matter from the asteroid in carefully shielded operations that generated minimal detectable signatures.

The Lucky Strike maintained its performance at 3102-Gamma, mining worthless iron ore with apparent enthusiasm.

"Extraction complete," Wrench finally reported. "We've got eighty kilograms of refined exotic matter. Enough to change everything."

"Secure it and get out. Slowly. Don't give them any reason to look."

Wrench packed the exotic matter into shielded containers, disguised among regular ore shipments. Moved the extractor back to the Lucky Strike piece by piece, each component looking like standard mining equipment.

Two days later, they were clear. The exotic matter was aboard, hidden, undetected.

And Helios was still focused on 3102-Gamma, watching the Lucky Strike mine worthless asteroids.

"Now what?" Sofia asked.

"Now we finish our mining contract at 3102-Gamma. Extract just enough iron ore to make the whole operation look legitimate. Then we move on to the next sector like nothing happened."

"And the exotic matter?"

"Hidden. Shielded. Waiting for the right moment to sell or use. But not yet. Not while Helios is watching."

"They'll figure it out eventually."

"Eventually isn't now. And every day we keep the secret is a day closer to being able to use it properly."

Kayla pulled up their route plan. "Where to next?"

"Somewhere boring. Somewhere that makes us look like struggling independent miners scraping by on marginal operations."

"So basically anywhere. We are struggling independent miners."

"Exactly. We look the part because we are the part. Helios will watch for a while, get bored, move on. And when they're not looking anymore..."

"We change the game."

Jax looked at his crew. They'd just pulled off the most dangerous operation of their mining careers. Stolen exotic matter from under consortium surveillance through distraction, improvisation, and sheer audacity.

And Helios didn't even know they'd lost.

That was worth celebrating.

Later, when they were far enough away to be safe.

For now, they'd play the role of disappointed miners who'd found another mediocre asteroid.

And quietly plan how to use eighty kilograms of exotic matter to rebuild their entire operation.

One careful step at a time.

One day of freedom from corporate control at a time.

One small victory in the endless battle between independents and consortiums.

It wasn't much.

But it was theirs.

And that made it everything.
