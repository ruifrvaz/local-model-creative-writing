The airlock cycled with a hiss of equalizing pressure. Lieutenant Commander Sarah Okonkwo stepped into the ready room, her EVA suit still beaded with frost from the external inspection.

"Hull integrity holding," she reported, pulling off her helmet. "But we've got microfractures along the dorsal plating. Nothing critical yet."

Elena studied the damage report on her tablet. "Source?"

"Quantum stress from the anomaly's presence. It's subtle, but the field effects are measurable." Okonkwo called up a 3D model of the ship. "Here, here, and here. The metal's crystalline structure is degrading."

"Time until critical failure?"

"At current exposure levels? Thirty-six hours." Okonkwo zoomed in on the worst damage. "After that, we start losing atmospheric integrity."

Marcus swore softly. "Can we reinforce it?"

"Not with what we have. The damage is molecular. We'd need to replace entire hull sections." Okonkwo collapsed the display. "Captain, we need to increase distance from the anomaly. At least five hundred thousand klicks."

"That breaks communication range," Patel interjected. "We're just starting to understand each other."

"We won't understand anything if we're dead," Okonkwo shot back.

Elena held up a hand. "How long can we maintain current proximity safely?"

Okonkwo calculated. "Twelve hours. Maybe fourteen if we rotate the ship to distribute the stress."

"Do it. Rotate every two hours. That buys us time."

"Time for what?" Okonkwo asked.

"To finish the conversation we started." Elena pulled up the latest transmissions from the anomaly. "It showed us its history. Now I want to know about Phobos."

"Captain, with respect, the hull won't care about your answers if it fails."

"Then we work fast." Elena turned to Marcus. "Get Chen's team on rotating the ship. Full diagnostic sweeps every hour. At the first sign of cascade failure, we pull back."

"Aye, Captain."

Okonkwo lingered after the others left. "Permission to speak freely?"

"Always."

"This is insane. We're risking the entire crew for information that Fleet Command specifically told you to ignore."

"They told me to stand down and wait. Not ignore." Elena met her eyes. "Phobos died because someone ignored warnings. I won't make that mistake."

"And if we die getting answers?"

"Then at least we die trying to prevent it from happening again." Elena softened her tone. "Sarah, I need you to trust me. Can you do that?"

Okonkwo was silent for a long moment. Then she nodded. "Twelve hours, Captain. After that, I'm pulling us back whether you like it or not."

"Fair enough."

After she left, Elena checked the hull stress readings herself. The numbers were worse than Okonkwo had said. They didn't have twelve hours.

They had eight. Maybe nine if they were lucky.

Elena sent a priority message to Patel: *Speed up translation. We're out of time.*

Then she sat back and watched the anomaly through the viewport. Beautiful. Deadly. Ancient beyond comprehension.

And still, somehow, patient.
