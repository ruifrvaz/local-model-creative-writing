The airlock cycled with a hiss of equalizing pressure. Lieutenant Commander Sarah Okonkwo stepped into the ready room, her EVA suit still beaded with frost from the external inspection.

"Hull integrity holding," she reported, pulling off her helmet. "But we've got microfractures along the dorsal plating. Nothing critical yet."

Her face was flushed from exertion, breath still coming fast from the EVA work. Three hours outside the ship, running handheld sensors across every square meter of the damaged sections. Dedicated. Thorough. Exactly the kind of officer Elena needed.

Elena studied the damage report on her tablet. "Source?"

"Quantum stress from the anomaly's presence. It's subtle, but the field effects are measurable." Okonkwo called up a 3D model of the ship. "Here, here, and here. The metal's crystalline structure is degrading."

The display rotated, highlighting damaged areas in angry red. The pattern was clear—concentrated along the sections facing the anomaly. Like radiation burns, but at the molecular level.

"Time until critical failure?"

"At current exposure levels? Thirty-six hours." Okonkwo zoomed in on the worst damage. "After that, we start losing atmospheric integrity."

Marcus swore softly. "Can we reinforce it?"

"Not with what we have. The damage is molecular. We'd need to replace entire hull sections." Okonkwo collapsed the display. "Captain, we need to increase distance from the anomaly. At least five hundred thousand klicks."

"That breaks communication range," Patel interjected. "We're just starting to understand each other."

"We won't understand anything if we're dead," Okonkwo shot back.

The tension in the room ratcheted up. Elena could see it in their faces—engineering versus science, survival versus discovery. The same conflict that had torn apart countless expeditions throughout history.

Elena held up a hand. "How long can we maintain current proximity safely?"

Okonkwo calculated, pulling up stress models and material degradation curves. "Twelve hours. Maybe fourteen if we rotate the ship to distribute the stress."

"Do it. Rotate every two hours. That buys us time."

"Time for what?" Okonkwo asked.

"To finish the conversation we started." Elena pulled up the latest transmissions from the anomaly. "It showed us its history. Now I want to know about Phobos."

"Captain, with respect, the hull won't care about your answers if it fails."

"Then we work fast." Elena turned to Marcus. "Get Chen's team on rotating the ship. Full diagnostic sweeps every hour. At the first sign of cascade failure, we pull back."

"Aye, Captain."

Okonkwo lingered after the others left. "Permission to speak freely?"

"Always."

"This is insane. We're risking the entire crew for information that Fleet Command specifically told you to ignore."

Elena met her gaze steadily. She'd expected this conversation. Okonkwo was too good an officer not to push back when she thought the captain was making a mistake.

"They told me to stand down and wait. Not ignore." Elena met her eyes. "Phobos died because someone ignored warnings. I won't make that mistake."

"And if we die getting answers?"

"Then at least we die trying to prevent it from happening again." Elena softened her tone. "Sarah, I need you to trust me. Can you do that?"

Okonkwo was silent for a long moment. Her jaw worked, conflicting loyalties warring across her face. Duty to the ship. Duty to the crew. Duty to the mission.

Then she nodded. "Twelve hours, Captain. After that, I'm pulling us back whether you like it or not."

"Fair enough."

After she left, Elena checked the hull stress readings herself. The numbers were worse than Okonkwo had said. The degradation wasn't linear—it was accelerating. Quantum effects didn't follow normal physical laws.

They didn't have twelve hours.

They had eight. Maybe nine if they were lucky.

Elena pulled up the damage projections, ran her own simulations. The models all pointed to the same conclusion: critical failure in eight to ten hours. The outer hull would breach first, then cascade through the ship's structure like a crack spreading through ice.

She considered pulling back. Increasing distance, buying time. But the anomaly had just started sharing information about Phobos. If they broke contact now, it might not resume communication. The opportunity would be lost.

Katie's voice echoed in her memory. "You can't save everyone, Elena. Sometimes you have to choose what to save."

Elena sent a priority message to Patel: *Speed up translation. We're out of time.*

His response came back immediately: *Understood. Working as fast as I can.*

Then she sat back and watched the anomaly through the viewport. Beautiful. Deadly. Ancient beyond comprehension.

And still, somehow, patient.

The ship rotated slowly beneath her, following Okonkwo's plan. The anomaly drifted across the viewport, energy patterns shifting across its surface like weather on an alien world. Elena wondered what it saw when it looked at the Meridian. A primitive ship? A curious species? Or just another test subject, like Phobos had been?

No. Not like Phobos. This time they were talking. This time they were trying to understand.

Her cybernetic fingers drummed against the armrest. Eight hours. Eight hours to learn what had killed her sister and three hundred others. Eight hours to prevent it from happening again.

She pulled up the rotation schedule. Every two hours, the ship would pivot on its axis, presenting fresh hull sections to the anomaly's influence. It would slow the degradation, but not stop it. Physics didn't care about human determination.

Elena activated the comm. "All hands, this is the captain. We're on a tight timeline. Rotation protocol is now in effect. Department heads, report status every thirty minutes. That is all."

Short. Direct. Professional.

Inside, her heart raced. But outside, she remained calm.

That's what captains did. They stayed calm while the hull cracked and time ran out.

They stayed calm, and they made the hard choices.

And sometimes, if they were lucky, those choices didn't kill everyone.
