Ambassador Chen Wu sat across from Director Tan and tried to read the subtext beneath the words.

"Your proposal is interesting," Tan said. "But the Pacific Alliance requires guarantees. Not promises."

"Guarantees in space are fiction," Chen said. "We're negotiating probabilities, not certainties."

"Then we're wasting time."

"Or we're learning to trust partial information." Chen pulled up the mining rights proposal. "You want Sector Seven-Beta. The European Federation wants the same territory. I'm proposing a partition that gives both factions access to viable sites."

"Viable isn't optimal."

"Optimal doesn't exist when both sides want the same resources."

Tan studied the proposal. Professional diplomat face—revealing nothing, missing nothing.

"The Pacific Alliance has operational presence. That establishes priority under treaty law."

"European Federation filed claims first. That establishes legal priority under the same treaties."

"Conflicting interpretations."

"Which is why we're here." Chen leaned forward. "Director Tan, we both know this negotiation isn't about mining rights. It's about establishing precedent. Who gets to claim priority in the belt. And that precedent matters more than any specific asteroid."

Tan's expression shifted slightly. Acknowledgment.

"You're more perceptive than most negotiators," Tan said.

"I've been doing this long enough to see the game beneath the game."

"And what game do you see?"

Chen pulled up a star map. "The belt is the future. Whoever controls resource extraction controls humanity's expansion into space. This negotiation sets the rules for every claim dispute that follows."

"So you're saying I should compromise for the long-term benefit of cooperative frameworks."

"I'm saying if you push too hard, the European Federation pushes back. Then corporate interests push in while you're fighting each other. And nobody wins except the companies."

Tan pulled up private files on his tablet. Reviewed something. Made a decision.

"The Pacific Alliance is willing to accept your partition. With conditions."

Chen felt hope spark. Careful. Negotiations collapsed fastest when success felt close.

"State them."

"We want independent verification of extraction rates. To ensure both sides honor the agreement."

"Acceptable. European Federation will likely demand the same."

"And we want Station Unity designated as the neutral arbiter for disputes. Not Earth. Not corporate tribunals. Here."

Chen absorbed that. Giving Station Unity authority elevated its position. Made it more than just neutral ground. Made it a governing body.

Risky. But potentially stable.

"I'll propose it to Larsson. But Tan? This requires trust. From both factions."

"I'm aware."

"Are you willing to trust the European Federation?"

Tan met his eyes. "I'm willing to trust you. That's why we're still here."

After the meeting, Chen found Director Nkrumah in the operations center.

"Tan's willing to accept the partition. With conditions."

"That's progress. What conditions?"

"Independent verification and Station Unity as arbiter."

Nkrumah pulled up the station's legal framework. "We're not set up to be a governing authority."

"We could be. If both factions accept it."

"Big if."

"Smaller than the alternative. Which is ongoing conflict and corporate exploitation."

Nkrumah thought about it. "I'll need to consult with the Colonial Authority. This changes Station Unity's role significantly."

"Do it quietly. If word gets out that we're considering expanded authority, other factions will want to interfere."

"Agreed. When are you meeting with Larsson?"

"Tomorrow. Assuming he's recovered from the bombing disruption."

"He has. Security says he's been in encrypted communications with Earth. Probably getting new negotiating parameters."

Chen nodded. European Federation wouldn't make this decision locally. Too much at stake.

He returned to his quarters and pulled up the diplomatic history files. Every major conflict in space had started with resource disputes. Mars water rights. Lunar mining territories. Orbital construction zones.

The pattern was clear. Fight over resources. Escalate to violence. Waste lives and materials. Eventually negotiate what should have been agreed at the start.

Chen's career had been breaking that pattern. Negotiating before violence. Building frameworks before crisis.

It worked. Sometimes. When factions were rational and leaders were wise.

Not always.

His terminal chimed. Encrypted message from an unlisted source.

Chen's diplomatic instincts screamed warning. But he opened it.

"Ambassador Wu. We appreciate your efforts to resolve the mining dispute peacefully. However, certain interests would prefer the conflict continue. We wanted you to be aware of this. Signed, A Friend."

Chen stared at the message. No details. No proof. Just a warning that someone wanted the negotiations to fail.

He forwarded it to Security Officer Volkov with a priority flag.

Her response came within minutes. "Received. Tracing source now. Recommend enhanced security protocols for remaining negotiation sessions."

Chen acknowledged and pulled up the schedule. Two more days of talks. Then both delegations would report to their respective governments. Success or failure would be determined by what they accomplished in that window.

Someone wanted failure. The bombing had been the first attempt. This message suggested there would be others.

Chen activated his secure comm to Lena Volkov.

"Officer Volkov. I want security presence in all negotiation sessions. Visible but not intrusive."

"You're expecting another attack?"

"I'm expecting someone to try something. I'd rather be prepared."

"Understood. I'll coordinate with both delegation security teams."

Chen closed the comm and thought about the message. "A friend" who wanted him aware of sabotage efforts. Not enough information to act on. Just enough to create paranoia.

Perfect psychological warfare.

He drafted his talking points for tomorrow's session with Larsson. The partition proposal. The verification framework. Station Unity as arbiter.

All contingent on both sides choosing cooperation over conflict.

Chen had been a diplomat long enough to know that choice wasn't guaranteed. Fear, pride, and political pressure could override rational interest.

His job was making cooperation the easier path. Building frameworks that made war more expensive than peace.

He thought about the three dead from the bombing. Marcus Webb and two maintenance workers. Lives lost because someone wanted these talks disrupted.

Chen wouldn't let their deaths be meaningless.

He'd negotiate the agreement. Build the framework. Establish precedent for peaceful resolution.

Or he'd fail. And watch the belt descend into conflict that would kill thousands more.

No pressure.

Chen pulled up the partition map and started refining details. Every clause mattered. Every word could be the difference between war and peace.

He worked through the night. Perfecting. Refining. Building an agreement that both sides could accept without losing face.

Outside his quarters, Station Unity rotated slowly. Neutral ground floating in the void. Hosting negotiations that would define humanity's future in space.

Chen hoped he was good enough.

History wouldn't forgive failure.
