Hassan stood in the underground chamber and tried to comprehend what he was seeing.

The void they'd discovered three weeks ago wasn't empty. It was inhabited.

The structure hung in the center of the spherical cavity, defying gravity. Geometric perfection that made his eyes hurt. Angles that seemed to exist in more than three dimensions. Surfaces that reflected light in ways that violated optics.

And it was active.

"Dr. Hassan." Alexis Kwan's voice cracked through his helmet comm. "You need to see this. The artifact is emitting signals."

Hassan approached the structure cautiously. His instruments picked up electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum. Radio waves. Microwaves. Visible light. X-rays. Gamma radiation. All pulsing in patterns that suggested intelligence.

"It's trying to communicate," he said.

"Or it's a weapon powering up." Alexis pulled up her scanner. "The energy output is increasing. Exponentially. At current rates, this thing will be radiating enough power to affect the surface in six hours."

"Affect how?"

"Unknown. But probably not favorably." Alexis highlighted the radiation curves. "Hassan, we need to tell Rivera. If this device activates, if it does something to the colony—"

"We need to understand it first. Shutting it down could be worse than letting it run." Hassan moved closer to the structure. The geometric patterns shifted as he approached. Responding to his presence. Or acknowledging it. "Alexis, record everything. If this is first contact with an ancient Martian intelligence, we need documentation."

He reached out. His gloved hand stopped centimeters from the surface. The structure pulsed. Light flowed through the geometric patterns. And Hassan felt something brush against his mind.

Not words. Not images. Pure mathematics. Equations that described reality in ways human physics had never conceived. Proofs of theorems that hadn't been imagined yet. Knowledge compressed into geometric forms that his brain struggled to process.

"Hassan, your neural activity just spiked." Alexis grabbed his arm. "You're seizing. Step back."

"No. It's teaching me. Showing me how it works." Hassan's vision blurred. The chamber spun. But underneath the disorientation, understanding flowered. "It's not Martian. It's older. Much older. This was here before Mars had an atmosphere. Before Earth had life. It's been waiting."

"Waiting for what?"

"For intelligence to find it. For life to evolve enough to understand." Hassan pulled back, his hand trembling. "It's a beacon. Or a test. Something left by a civilization that existed when the universe was young. And it's still active. Still waiting for someone to pass whatever trial it represents."

Alexis looked at the structure with new eyes. "What kind of trial?"

"I don't know. But I think the colony's transformation isn't an accident. The crystalline structures in the soil, the biological modifications we're experiencing—they're part of the test. The artifact is changing us. Making us into something that can interface with it. Understand it. Maybe even use it."

"Use it for what?"

Hassan pulled up his geological surveys. The chamber was deep. But the artifact's energy signature extended deeper. Through the crust. Into the mantle. Possibly to Mars's core.

"It's connected to the planet," he said. "Integrated with the geological structure at a fundamental level. This artifact isn't sitting on Mars. It is Mars. Or part of Mars. The whole planet might be a machine. A device left by whoever built this. And we've been living on top of it for weeks without realizing."

Alexis backed away from the structure. "We need to evacuate. Now. If Mars is an alien machine, if we've activated it by living here—"

"We can't evacuate. The transformation is already happening. We're already part of whatever this machine does." Hassan pulled up the biological analysis Tanaka had shared. "Look at the cellular modifications. The crystalline structures aren't contamination. They're upgrades. Turning us into biological processors. Nodes in a network the artifact can interface with."

"You're saying it's converting us into computers?"

"I'm saying it's converting us into something that can understand it. Communicate with it. Maybe even merge with it." Hassan looked at the pulsing structure. "The question is whether we let it finish or fight it."

"Fighting seems smart. Since we don't know what it wants."

"It wants to be understood. That's what beacons do. They wait for intelligent life to find them. To prove themselves worthy of whatever knowledge or power the beacon grants." Hassan activated his suit recorder. "I'm going to touch it again. Get full documentation. If I die or transform into something incomprehensible, make sure the data gets to Earth."

"Hassan, that's insane—"

He touched the structure before Alexis could stop him.

The universe inverted.

Hassan existed everywhere simultaneously. In the chamber. On the surface. In Earth's orbit. Scattered across the solar system in fragments of consciousness that saw everything from every angle.

The artifact was showing him what it could do. What he could do, if he accepted its gift.

He saw Mars's history. The planet alive with water and atmosphere. Civilizations rising and falling. The artifact waiting patiently through geological ages. Until humanity arrived and triggered the next phase.

He saw the future. Mars transformed. Not terraformed—something better. The crystalline network spreading through human biology. Connecting minds. Creating a collective intelligence that could interface with the artifact. Unlock its secrets. Access the knowledge of civilizations that had died before Earth's sun ignited.

And he saw the price. Humanity as it existed would end. The transformation was irreversible. Once integrated with the crystalline network, returning to baseline human biology would be fatal.

They would become something new. Homo mechanicus. Humanity merged with ancient technology. Capable of processing information at rates that made modern computers look like abacuses.

But no longer human in any way that mattered.

Hassan pulled back. The visions faded. He collapsed to his knees, gasping inside his helmet.

"Hassan!" Alexis caught him. "What happened? Your vitals went critical. Your brain activity—"

"I saw what we're becoming. What the artifact wants us to become." Hassan looked at his gloved hands. They were shaking. "It's offering transcendence. Evolution. Power beyond anything humanity has achieved. But it requires us to abandon our biology. Our individuality. Everything that makes us human."

"And you're considering it?"

"I'm terrified of it. But I'm also tempted. Because what it's offering is magnificent." Hassan stood slowly. "Alexis, we need to present this to the crew. Let them decide. Some might want to accept the transformation. Others might want to die as humans rather than live as something else. Both choices are valid."

"You think people will volunteer for this?"

"I think some already have. Tanaka. Rivera. Everyone who accepted the first contamination. They're already transforming. Already merging with the network. The artifact just accelerates it. Makes it conscious instead of accidental." Hassan looked at the structure one more time. "The question isn't whether we transform. That's happening. The question is whether we understand what we're transforming into before it's complete."

Alexis was quiet for a long time. Then she pulled out her own recorder.

"Then let's get more data. Because if we're selling humanity on becoming alien, we'd better have a really compelling pitch."

Hassan nodded. They approached the artifact together. Two humans on the edge of transformation. On the threshold of understanding.

The structure pulsed in what Hassan interpreted as welcome.

Or hunger.

Hard to tell which.

Either way, they were committed now.

Mars had chosen them. And the artifact was waiting to see what they'd choose in return.
