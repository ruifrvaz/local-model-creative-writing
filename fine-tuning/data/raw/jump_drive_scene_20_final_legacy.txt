Dr. Kenji Yamamoto was eighty-four when Sarah Chen died. Exactly eleven years after her MIT lecture. Exactly as she'd predicted across probable timelines.

The funeral was held in temporal community on Mars. Appropriate. Sarah had spent her final years among others experiencing all moments simultaneously. Among people who understood temporal omniscience as normal instead of alien.

Kenji made the journey despite his age. Three-second FTL jump from Earth to Mars. Technology Sarah had pioneered. Infrastructure built on her sacrifice.

The temporal community gathered in ways linear humans couldn't quite follow. They experienced the funeral across multiple moments. Past memorial planning. Present ceremony. Future remembrance. All simultaneous in their collective awareness.

Sarah's body lay in state. She'd died from cellular fragmentation—exactly the cause she'd predicted. Her temporal processing centers had sustained consciousness until the final moment. Then collapse. Biological failure across incompatible temporal states.

She'd experienced her own death while living. Known the exact moment across probability waves. Faced it with characteristic determination.

Dr. Aisha Mbara, now seventy-nine, stood beside the casket. "She was the first. The prototype. The warning and the promise. Everything we've achieved in FTL travel traces back to her first jump thirty-one years ago."

Lieutenant Yuki Tanaka spoke next. Still temporal-adapted. Still piloting commercial runs. "Sarah showed us that consciousness could exist across multiple temporal states. That humans could adapt to non-linear causality. That expansion required transformation."

Her daughter Akari, now sixteen and experiencing all moments simultaneously since birth, added: "She taught us that temporal consciousness wasn't disability. It was evolution. Different from linear experience but equally valid. She lived that truth for thirty-one years."

The temporal attendees experienced the eulogies across all moments. Had heard them before during planning. Heard them now during ceremony. Would hear them again in future remembrance. All equally vivid in temporal omniscience.

Kenji struggled to follow the temporal ceremony's structure. It didn't progress linearly. Past, present, future mixed freely. Speakers referenced events that hadn't happened yet. Attendees responded to statements not yet made.

The experiential gap between linear and temporal consciousness was absolute.

"Dr. Yamamoto," Akari approached after the main ceremony. "Sarah wanted me to give you something. She recorded it eleven years ago but specified it should be delivered at her funeral."

She handed him a data chip. Kenji loaded it on his personal terminal. Sarah's face appeared—recorded at the MIT lecture, when she'd first revealed her predicted death.

"Kenji," the recording began. "If you're watching this, I'm dead. Cellular fragmentation finally exceeded biological sustainability. Exactly as I experienced across probable futures."

She paused. Even in recording, her eyes had that distant quality of experiencing multiple moments.

"I want to thank you. For building the FTL program. For creating portable generators. For thirty-one years of research supporting temporal-adapted pilots. You made this possible."

The recording showed Sarah in her MIT office. Behind her, windows overlooking campus where linear students and temporal students attempted cross-experiential communication.

"I don't regret volunteering. I've told you that many times. But I want to say it again at my death. The cost was high—my linear consciousness, my normal experience of causality, my biological longevity. But the gain was infinite. Humanity expanded beyond Earth. Established colonies across the solar system. Evolved into multiple experiential modes."

She pulled up statistics. Numbers Kenji recognized from current FTL operations.

"Sixty-five thousand temporal-adapted individuals. Twelve thousand active FTL pilots. Colonies on Mars, Europa, Titan, orbital stations throughout the solar system. All because forty-three pilots volunteered to fragment their consciousness. All because we succeeded despite catastrophic costs."

Sarah's recorded image looked directly at the camera. Past communication reaching present reception reaching future remembrance.

"Tell future generations about us. The forty-three volunteers. The sixteen catastrophic failures. The twenty-seven successful adaptations. Tell them what consciousness fragmentation cost. But also tell them what it achieved. Let them choose with full information."

The recording ended. Sarah's face frozen in final frame. A woman who'd experienced all moments simultaneously for thirty-one years. Who'd died exactly when she'd predicted. Who'd left legacy spanning human civilization's expansion into space.

Kenji closed the file and felt thirty-one years of history compress into single moment. Sarah's first jump. Her adaptation. The memorial walls. The social divergence. The portable generators. The MIT lecture. And now her death.

All connected. All necessary. All part of humanity's transformation from single-experiential species to diversified consciousness.

The temporal ceremony concluded in ways that didn't follow linear sequence. Attendees departed experiencing farewells across multiple moments. Past gathering. Present ceremony. Future remembrance. All simultaneous in collective temporal awareness.

Kenji returned to Earth carrying Sarah's final message. He presented it to the FTL program administration. They archived it with the original research data. Made it available to all future volunteers.

Sarah Chen's complete story. From first volunteer to catastrophic adaptation to thirty-one years of temporal omniscience to predicted death from biological failure.

The cost. The gain. The transformation.

All documented for future generations who'd face the same choice.

Three months after Sarah's funeral, Dr. Emma Torres compiled the final statistical analysis. Sixty-five thousand temporal-adapted individuals. Forty-three percent through FTL exposure. Fifty-seven percent born temporal. Population growth accelerating.

"Within fifty years, temporal humans will be the majority consciousness in space-based populations," she told Kenji during a research review. "Within a century, they'll outnumber linear humans in total human population."

"Because FTL operations require temporal consciousness?"

"Because space-based living selects for temporal adaptation. The environment favors non-linear causality perception. Temporal children thrive in space communities while linear children struggle."

"Natural selection accelerated by technology."

"Evolution. Same as always. Just faster because we're actively creating the environmental pressure."

Kenji pulled up the memorial records. Sarah's name now permanently engraved alongside the original forty-three volunteers. First adapted pilot. First biological casualty of sustained temporal omniscience. Pioneer. Warning. Legacy.

"She knew this would happen. Saw it across probable futures. Chose it anyway."

"Because the mission mattered more than individual longevity. Same reason all forty-four volunteers made their choices."

Emma pulled up long-term projections. "We're creating new humanity. Temporal consciousness as normal. Linear experience as historical. Within two centuries, someone will ask why humans ever experienced time sequentially. Temporal omniscience will be the baseline."

"And linear humans?"

"Will remain on Earth. Preserve original human consciousness. Maintain genetic diversity. Both populations will be human. Just different expressions."

Kenji thought about Sarah experiencing her entire existence across all moments. Past childhood. Present contribution. Future legacy. All equally vivid in temporal omniscience until biological failure ended the experience.

"Was it worth it?"

Emma met his eyes. "Ask the sixty-five thousand temporal-adapted individuals. Ask the twelve thousand pilots enabling instant interplanetary travel. Ask the billions living in space colonies built on FTL infrastructure. They'll tell you yes."

"Ask the sixteen catastrophic failures."

"Ask their families who received full benefits and saw their sacrifices honored. Ask David Chen's parents who attend every memorial ceremony. Ask Lieutenant Park's sister who named her temporal-born daughter after him. They'll tell you the same. Worth it."

The math was brutal. The ethics were complex. The outcome was irreversible.

Humanity had transformed. Diversified. Evolved beyond single-consciousness species.

All because Sarah Chen and forty-three others had volunteered to fragment across temporal states. All because Kenji had built the technology enabling that fragmentation. All because Admiral Kowalski had pushed the program forward despite catastrophic costs.

Worth it or not, the question was meaningless now. The transformation was complete.

Kenji was eighty-four. Experiencing linear time. Sequential causality. Normal human consciousness of past becoming present becoming future.

Soon he'd die. His consciousness would end. Linear experience terminating at biological failure.

Unlike Sarah, he wouldn't experience his death across all moments. Wouldn't exist simultaneously in past, present, future. Wouldn't perceive his own memorial across probable timelines.

He'd just end. Simply. Finally. The way linear humans always had.

Was that worse than temporal omniscience? Or better?

Sarah would say different, not worse. Kenji wasn't certain.

But he was certain of one thing: They'd succeeded. Built FTL capability. Enabled expansion. Transformed humanity into multiple experiential modes.

The cost was forty-four lives transformed beyond recognition.

The gain was human civilization spanning the solar system.

Sarah Chen would say the math was obvious.

Kenji hoped she was right.

Across all moments.

Forever.

The way she'd experienced it.

Until the inevitable end.

Which she'd predicted.

Which she'd accepted.

Which she'd chosen anyway.

Because the mission mattered.

More than individual comfort.

More than normal consciousness.

More than life itself.

That was Sarah Chen's legacy.

The first temporal-adapted pilot.

The prototype for humanity's future.

The woman who'd experienced all moments until biology failed.

And chosen it willingly.

Every time.

Across all probability waves.

Forever.
