The medical bay was quiet at night. Dr. James Okoye sat alone, reviewing genetic screening data. Forty-seven crew members with serious hereditary markers. Twelve children showing early signs of genetic disorders. Population-level diversity metrics declining faster than projected.

His tablet chimed. Emergency case incoming.

The young woman who arrived was bleeding from a self-inflicted wound. Wrist cuts, deep but not immediately fatal. Chen Ming, age twenty-four, fourth-generation crew member. Agricultural technician. No prior mental health incidents in her record.

"I'm going to treat your wounds," James said calmly. "Then we're going to talk."

Ming didn't respond. Just stared at nothing while he cleaned and sealed the cuts. The medical glue would hold. Physical damage was straightforward to repair. Psychological damage required different tools.

After the wounds were treated, James pulled up a chair. "Want to tell me what happened?"

"What's the point? Of any of this?"

Classic existential crisis. James had seen three in the past month. All fourth-generation crew members. All between ages twenty and thirty. All asking the same fundamental question about meaning and purpose.

"The point is continuing the mission. Reaching Tau Ceti. Establishing humanity's first extrasolar colony."

"I'll be dead before we get there. So will my children. Possibly my grandchildren. We're just... maintaining systems for people who don't exist yet."

"That's how generational missions work."

"It's insane. We're prisoners on this ship, dedicating our lives to goals we'll never achieve, for people who'll never thank us."

James set down his medical scanner. This required more than clinical response. "You're right. The mission asks impossible things. Sacrifice without direct reward. Dedication without gratification. Purpose divorced from personal achievement."

Ming looked up, surprised. "You're supposed to tell me it's worth it."

"I'm supposed to tell you the truth. Whether it's worth it is something each person decides for themselves."

"And if I decide it's not?"

"Then we talk about coping mechanisms. Ways to find meaning within constrained choices. Methods for surviving situations you didn't choose."

Ming pulled her bandaged wrists close to her chest. "My great-grandmother chose this mission. Volunteered to board the ship knowing she'd die in transit. She believed in the destination enough to sacrifice her entire life for it."

"And you don't share that belief."

"I don't have that belief. I was born here. I never chose this. Every day I wake up and the ship is still here, still flying, still requiring maintenance. Forever. Until I die. That's my entire existence."

James pulled up the psychological support protocols. Fourth-generation crew showing increasing rates of depression, anxiety, existential distress. The pattern was clear. As generational distance from Earth increased, connection to mission purpose decreased.

"Have you talked to anyone else about these feelings?"

"My shift supervisor. He said everyone feels this way sometimes. To focus on my work and it would pass."

Standard supervisor response. Pragmatic but inadequate for serious psychological distress.

"I'm going to recommend counseling sessions. Regular meetings with our psychological support team. They can help you develop coping strategies."

"Coping isn't the same as fixing the problem."

"No. But the problem—being born on a generation ship—can't be fixed. Only coped with."

Ming stood abruptly. "I want to leave. Transfer to different duty. Something that doesn't remind me constantly that I'm trapped."

"There's nowhere to transfer to. Every role serves the mission. Every job exists to maintain the ship."

"Exactly. That's exactly the problem. There's no escape. No alternative. No way to choose something different."

James understood. He'd felt it himself occasionally. The weight of inherited purpose, the constraint of limited options, the grinding reality of maintenance without end.

"I felt the same way when I was your age," he said quietly. "Angry that my parents had brought me into this situation. Resentful that my entire life was predetermined by their choices. Desperate for any alternative except the mission."

"What changed?"

"I stopped looking for alternatives and started looking for meaning within constraints. I couldn't choose whether to be on the ship. But I could choose how to contribute. What role to serve. Who to help. Those choices mattered even when the larger context didn't."

Ming sat back down. "That sounds like rationalizing captivity."

"It is. Sophisticated rationalization is the primary psychological tool for surviving unchosen circumstances. Some call it coping. Some call it acceptance. Some call it wisdom. Different words for the same process—finding meaning despite constraint."

"I don't want to rationalize. I want real choices."

"Then choose within available options. Agriculture or engineering. Medical or education. Cultural work or technical maintenance. Family or solitude. Contribution or resistance. Those choices are real even if the broader context is fixed."

Ming pulled up her duty roster on her tablet. "I work sixteen hours every three days. Hydroponic maintenance, crop monitoring, nutrient balancing. It's repetitive. Meaningless. Just maintaining systems so other people can eat food I grew for a future I'll never see."

"Or it's ensuring three thousand people survive. Providing essential nutrition. Sustaining life in a hostile environment. Same facts, different interpretation."

"You're very good at reframing."

"It's a skill developed over decades of confined existence. I can teach you if you're interested."

Ming was silent for a long moment. Then: "My grandmother killed herself. Year one-seventy-three. No one told me until I was eighteen. They said she had medical complications. But I found her file. Self-administered overdose. She couldn't handle the confinement."

James pulled the file. Chen Shu-fen, died age forty-seven, medical intervention insufficient. The record indicated depression, existential distress, refusal of psychological treatment.

"I'm sorry. That must be difficult to carry."

"I think about it constantly. Whether I'm going to end up the same way. Whether the feelings I have are temporary or permanent. Whether I'm fundamentally unsuited for this existence."

"Genetic predisposition to depression is trackable. We can screen for markers that indicate higher risk."

"I've already been screened. Twenty percent elevated risk compared to baseline population. Not enough to warrant intervention, but enough to worry about."

James made notes in her medical file. Suicide attempt, family history, genetic markers, existential distress. This required comprehensive treatment, not just bandaging wounds.

"I'm placing you on medical leave for two weeks. You'll have daily counseling sessions, cognitive therapy, and medication if you consent to it. We treat this as seriously as any physical illness."

"The ship needs agricultural workers."

"The ship needs healthy crew members. If you're experiencing suicidal ideation, you're not fit for duty. We cover your shifts with backup personnel."

Ming looked relieved. Permission to stop, to rest, to acknowledge the struggle. Sometimes that was all people needed—validation that their distress mattered.

"What if the counseling doesn't help? What if I still feel like this in two weeks?"

"Then we continue treatment. Adjust approaches. Try different interventions. We don't give up on crew members because recovery is difficult."

"Even when recovery means accepting permanent confinement?"

"Especially then. Because confinement doesn't preclude meaningful existence. You can hate the circumstances and still find purpose within them."

James pulled up success stories. Fourth-generation crew members who'd struggled with similar issues, received treatment, developed coping mechanisms, now thrived in various roles.

"These people all felt the way you do. Trapped, purposeless, resentful. They worked through it. Some found meaning in family. Some in technical excellence. Some in cultural preservation. Some in simple daily satisfaction of contributing to crew survival."

Ming studied the profiles. "They look happy. Or at least functional."

"Happiness is optional. Functionality is required. If we can achieve both, excellent. If only functionality, that's still success."

"Depressing standard."

"Realistic standard. We work with what's possible, not what's ideal."

Ming stood, tested her balance. The blood loss was minimal. Physically she'd recover quickly. Psychologically would take longer.

"I'll do the counseling. I'll try the treatment. But I can't promise it'll work."

"I'm not asking for promises. Just participation. Show up, engage honestly, give the process a chance."

After Ming left, James updated her file with treatment plans, medication recommendations, counseling schedule. Then he pulled up the broader psychological data.

Fourth-generation mental health incidents: increasing. Suicide attempts: three in the past year, all fourth-generation. Existential distress reports: forty-seven cases currently active.

The pattern was undeniable. As generational distance from Earth increased, psychological strain increased. The third generation had struggled but maintained purpose through connection to the second generation's lived memory. The fourth generation lacked that connection. They'd never known anyone who'd experienced Earth or spoken with the mission founders.

They were truly ship-born. Ship-raised. Ship-bound. The first generation with no living connection to why the journey began.

James composed a report for Captain Reyes. Psychological support resources needed expansion. Cultural education programs required redesign to address fourth-generation existential questions. Mission purpose needed reframing for crew members who'd never experience the destination.

This was the hidden cost of generational missions. Not just technical challenges and genetic diversity. But psychological sustainability. Maintaining will across centuries when individuals lived decades. Preserving purpose when personal achievement was impossible.

The mission planners had anticipated technical difficulties. They'd prepared for systems failures and resource constraints. But they'd underestimated the psychological burden of inherited purpose without chosen meaning.

James had to fix that. Or at least develop tools for the fourth generation to survive it.

He pulled up Chen Ming's profile. Twenty-four years old. Forty-seven percent of her estimated lifespan remaining. Born on the ship. Would die on the ship. Would never see Earth or Tau Ceti. Would spend her entire existence maintaining systems for hypothetical future people.

That reality broke some people. The question was whether it broke most people. Whether the fourth generation could psychologically sustain the mission. Whether fifth and sixth generations would even try.

James didn't have answers. Just data, concerns, and a commitment to help crew members survive the psychological weight of unchosen existence.

One session at a time. One intervention at a time. One life preserved at a time.

Because what else could he do? He was ship-born too. Constrained by the same circumstances. Finding meaning in the same impossible situation.

If he could survive it, so could Chen Ming. So could the rest of the fourth generation.

They just needed tools. Support. Permission to struggle. Validation that their distress was rational and survivable.

James could provide that. It was his role. His purpose. His way of finding meaning within constraint.

Help others survive what you've survived. Pass forward the psychological tools that worked. Adapt them for each generation's specific challenges.

That was sustainable. That was achievable. That was his contribution to the mission.

One life at a time. One intervention at a time. One generation at a time.

Until they reached Tau Ceti. Or developed a new purpose that transcended the destination. Or discovered that the journey itself was the achievement.

Whatever came next, James would be there. Helping crew members survive it. One session at a time.
