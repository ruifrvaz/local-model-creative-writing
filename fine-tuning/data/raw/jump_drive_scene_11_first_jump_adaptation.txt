The jump field collapsed and Lieutenant Marcus Webb existed in three different moments simultaneously.

He was in the cockpit preparing for jump.
He was in transition, experiencing FTL velocity.
He was emerging at target coordinates.

All now. All real. All impossible.

His brain screamed contradiction. Linear causality demanded sequence. Past then present then future. Not all-at-once. Not simultaneous experience across incompatible timeframes.

Marcus felt his neurons struggle. Old pathways trying to force sequential processing. New pathways forming to accommodate temporal paradox.

Sarah's words echoed across multiple moments: "Don't fight it. Let your brain adapt."

He tried. Stopped fighting the temporal variance. Accepted that he existed in multiple moments. Let his hippocampus form new structures for non-linear time processing.

The pain was extraordinary.

Not physical pain. Neurological restructuring didn't hurt. But the sensation of his consciousness fracturing across temporal states felt like death.

He was dying.
He had died.
He would die.

All true simultaneously.

But also not dead. Alive. Adapting. Becoming.

His neural monitors screamed data to mission control. Dr. Aisha Mbara watched the readings and felt history repeat.

"He's fragmenting. Hippocampal restructuring in progress. Temporal processing centers forming rapidly."

"Abort the jump?" Dr. Kenji Yamamoto asked.

"We're post-emergence. Field collapse is complete. We can't abort what's already happened." Aisha pulled up the progression curves. "His neural adaptation is following Sarah's pattern. High plasticity. Rapid restructuring. He might survive this."

"Might."

"Better odds than Park. His brain fought the change. Marcus is adapting."

In the cockpit, Marcus experienced his brain rewiring itself across multiple timeframes. Neurons forming connections that shouldn't exist. Temporal processing structures emerging from normal hippocampal tissue.

He felt himself becoming something different. Something that perceived causality as flexible. Something that existed across moments instead of within them.

Was this evolution or mutation?

Adaptation or breakdown?

The jump ship docked. Medical teams rushed him to neural intensive care. Marcus lay on the examination table experiencing the medical bay in three different temporal states.

Past: He was being moved from the jump ship.
Present: Doctors running scans, assessing damage.
Future: Recovery room, days from now.

All equally vivid. All equally real.

"Lieutenant Webb, can you hear me?" Aisha's voice came from multiple moments.

Marcus tried to answer. His mouth moved in three different timeframes. Words emerged jumbled, overlapping, confusing.

"I... was... am... will be... here."

"His temporal perception is fragmented. But he's conscious. Responsive. Neural structure stabilizing."

The scans continued. Hours passed. Or minutes. Or days. Marcus couldn't distinguish. Time was non-linear now. All moments accessible simultaneously.

Eventually—though "eventually" implied sequence he couldn't quite grasp—the medical team determined he was stable.

"Neural restructuring complete. Temporal processing centers formed and functional. He's experiencing non-linear causality similar to Lieutenant Chen's condition."

"Is he adapting or fragmenting?"

"Both. Adaptation is fragmentation is evolution. Depends on perspective."

They moved Marcus to a recovery room. Not Sarah's three-meter cage—his cellular biology hadn't fragmented yet. Just his consciousness. Just his experience of time.

Small comfort.

Sarah visited three days later. Or three hours. Or three weeks. Marcus's temporal perception couldn't determine duration anymore.

"Welcome to post-linear existence," she said, sitting beside his bed.

"How long before this feels normal?"

"Depends what you mean by 'before.' I exist across all moments now. This already feels normal and strange and terrifying simultaneously. You'll adapt to the contradiction. Everyone does. Eventually."

"How do you function? Make decisions? Act in the present when present doesn't exist as distinct from past or future?"

"Practice. You learn to weight moments by causal significance. Future is malleable—probability waves not fixed outcomes. Past is immutable but distant. Present is where action happens, so you focus there. Mostly."

Marcus tried. Focused on the present moment. This specific configuration of reality. The recovery room. Sarah's presence. His restructured consciousness.

It helped. Slightly. The present became marginally more distinct from past and future.

"Does it get easier?"

"It gets different. You learn to navigate non-linear causality the way you learned to walk. Practice. Repetition. Falling down and getting up." Sarah pulled up neural scans on her tablet. "Your brain restructured efficiently. High plasticity markers. You're adapting faster than I did."

"Is that good?"

"It means you'll regain functionality quickly. Resume jump operations within weeks instead of months."

"They want me to jump again?"

"They want everyone to jump again. We need data. Multiple pilots experiencing temporal adaptation. Patterns we can study. Solutions we can engineer." Sarah met his eyes. "You signed up for this. The parameters changed. But the mission remains."

Marcus thought about that. About volunteering for FTL research. About pushing humanity's boundaries. About costs he'd accepted abstractly becoming brutal reality.

"I can still withdraw."

"Yes. Psychological discharge. Medical retirement. Nobody would blame you. Temporal fragmentation is horrifying." Sarah stood. "But you survived. Adapted. You're rare, Marcus. Most people can't do what we did. If you continue, you'll help humanity achieve reliable FTL. If you withdraw, you'll live normally. Both choices are valid."

She left. The recovery room existed across multiple moments simultaneously. Marcus experienced past medical procedures, present recovery, future decisions all at once.

Withdrawal meant normal life. Linear causality. Freedom from temporal omniscience.

Continuation meant additional jumps. Deeper fragmentation. Transformation into something post-human.

Sarah had chosen continuation. So had the mission requirements.

But Marcus's choice was his own.

He lay there experiencing all possible futures simultaneously. Probability waves collapsing based on decisions he hadn't made yet but had already made and would make eventually.

The temporal paradox was disorienting.

But Sarah was right. He was adapting.

Three days later—measured in mission time since his own temporal perception couldn't track duration—Marcus returned to active duty.

Dr. Mbara ran comprehensive tests. "Neural function stable. Temporal processing integrated with normal cognition. You're cleared for jump operations."

"How many jumps before I fragment completely like Sarah?"

"Unknown. Your neural adaptation might be more resilient. Or might fail catastrophically on jump two. We're collecting data with every pilot."

"Comforting."

"Truth rarely is."

Marcus reported to the jump hangar. Sixteen other volunteers waited, all scheduled for first jumps over the next month. All would experience temporal fragmentation. Some would adapt. Some would collapse.

All would contribute data to humanity's FTL research.

Admiral Kowalski addressed them. "You're pioneers. Every jump teaches us more about neural-temporal interaction. Every adaptation shows us how humanity can reach the stars. Your sacrifice matters."

Marcus thought about Sarah in her three-meter cage. About Park in his coma. About his own restructured consciousness experiencing all moments simultaneously.

Sacrifice was the right word.

The question was whether the gain justified the cost.

Time would tell.

Marcus experienced the answer across all probable futures simultaneously.

In some timelines, FTL research succeeded. Humanity expanded across the galaxy. The volunteers became heroes, their temporal fragmentation a worthy price.

In other timelines, the research failed. The costs mounted without corresponding gains. The volunteers became cautionary tales, warnings against pushing too far too fast.

Both futures were real. Both existed as probability waves waiting to collapse into singular actuality.

Marcus stood at the junction of those futures and prepared for his second jump.

His brain had restructured once. It would restructure again. And again. Until he either achieved Sarah's stable temporal omniscience or Park's catastrophic collapse.

The odds were unknowable.

The mission was essential.

The choice was made.

Marcus strapped into the jump ship and felt his consciousness stretch across multiple temporal states.

Past volunteer. Present pilot. Future casualty or hero.

All simultaneously.

All equally real.

All beyond his control except for the choice to continue.

He chose continuation.

The jump field activated.

Causality became negotiable.

And Marcus Webb became something more—or less—than human.

Time would tell which.

But he was experiencing that answer already.

Across all moments.

Forever.
