Commander Rivera stood in the communications center and composed the hardest message of her career.

"Colonial Authority. This is Commander Ana Rivera, Mars Colony Perseverance. We have made contact with what appears to be ancient alien technology. Repeat: first contact has occurred. Requesting immediate specialist support and updated protocols."

She saved the transmission but didn't send it immediately. Once this went out, everything changed.

The colony would be swarmed with specialists. Corporate interests would intensify. Earth's military would want involvement. Their small research outpost would become the center of humanity's first confirmed contact with alien intelligence.

And Omar Hassan, her geologist, carried alien knowledge in his brain.

"Commander." Omar appeared in the doorway. "I've been documenting what the sphere taught me. The mathematics. The physics. It's... comprehensive."

"Can you function? Work normally?"

"Define normally. I can do my job. But I also have access to engineering principles that could revolutionize our technology. It's like having a second education running parallel to my original knowledge."

Rivera pulled up his medical scans. Dr. Patel had been monitoring Omar continuously. The neural activity was unusual but stable. No degradation. No harmful effects.

Just enhanced capability.

"How much information did it give you?" Rivera asked.

"I don't know the full extent yet. Information seems to unpack over time. Like delayed downloads. Each day I understand more."

"Is it controlling you? Influencing your decisions?"

Omar thought about it honestly. "I don't think so. I still feel like me. Just... augmented. Like I went to a university that doesn't exist and learned physics humanity hasn't discovered."

Rivera made her decision. "We send the message. Report everything. And we prepare for Earth to take over the operation."

"What happens to me?"

"You become the most important scientist in human history. They'll want to study you. Learn from you. Extract every piece of information the sphere gave you."

"I'm not a resource to be exploited."

"No. You're a person who had an unprecedented experience. But Earth won't see it that way. They'll see you as access to alien technology."

Omar pulled up his documentation. "Then I'd better make sure the information is preserved. Shared. Not locked in my head where only government researchers can access it."

"You're talking about releasing classified first contact data."

"I'm talking about making sure humanity benefits from this. Not just corporations or militaries."

Rivera thought about her obligations. To the Colonial Authority. To the colony. To the broader mission of peaceful exploration.

And to the man in front of her who'd volunteered for a dangerous descent and come back changed.

"Document everything," she said. "Thoroughly. We'll decide what to share and what to protect. But Omar? You're right. This knowledge shouldn't be hoarded."

After he left, Rivera pulled up the transmission again. Added a section about Omar's condition. The information transfer. The implications.

Then sent it.

The message would take eighteen hours to reach Earth. Response would take another eighteen. Thirty-six hours of autonomy before the specialists arrived and everything changed.

Rivera gathered the senior staff.

"We have thirty-six hours before Earth responds. I want full documentation of everything we've learned. The cavity. The sphere. Omar's knowledge transfer. Complete scientific record."

"And then?" Alexis asked.

"Then we share it. With everyone. Scientific institutions. Universities. The whole research community. We make this discovery belong to humanity, not just governments."

"That'll piss off the Colonial Authority," Chen said.

"Probably. But it's the right thing to do. We found something that could change civilization. Keeping it locked behind classified protocols wastes its potential."

The colony worked through the next thirty-six hours. Documenting. Analyzing. Preparing the data package that would be their legacy.

Omar spent the time translating alien mathematics into human-comprehensible format. The sphere's knowledge was dense. Complex. But translatable.

"It's like they knew we'd need this explained simply," he told Priya. "The mathematics are advanced, but the teaching method is basic. Step-by-step. Building from fundamentals."

"They wanted to be understood."

"They wanted to help whoever found them reach the next level. Like teachers leaving lessons for students they'd never meet."

The data package assembled. Twelve terabytes of documentation. Every observation. Every theory. Omar's translated mathematics. Complete scientific record of humanity's first confirmed contact with alien intelligence.

Rivera reviewed it one final time. This was it. The moment that defined their mission. The discovery that would be remembered for millennia.

She transmitted it. Not just to Earth. To every scientific institution in the system. Every university. Every research facility.

Open access. Complete transparency. Knowledge shared freely.

The Colonial Authority's response came exactly thirty-six hours after her first message.

"Commander Rivera. Your actions in releasing classified first contact data without authorization are noted. However, given the unprecedented nature of the discovery and the global scientific interest, we are retroactively authorizing the release. Specialist team en route. ETA forty-two days. Maintain documentation protocols. Authority out."

Rivera smiled. Sometimes asking forgiveness was easier than asking permission.

Alexis appeared in the communications center. "We're heroes or we're fired. I can't tell which."

"We're scientists who made a discovery and shared it appropriately. Everything else is politics."

"That's a nice way of saying we might have ended our careers."

"If sharing the most significant discovery in human history ends our careers, I'm okay with that."

They stood in the communications center and watched the data propagate through the system. Universities downloading. Researchers analyzing. The knowledge spreading faster than anyone could stop it.

Somewhere in the Martian subsurface, the sphere sat dormant. Having fulfilled its purpose. Having taught the next generation.

Rivera thought about the beings who'd created it. Who'd left knowledge scattered across planets. Who'd designed teaching systems that could wait millions of years for students to arrive.

They were long dead. But their legacy persisted.

And humanity had just become their newest students.

Rivera pulled up the colony status. Systems nominal. Crew healthy. Discovery documented.

Mission accomplished.

Whatever came next—specialists, oversight, potential consequences—they'd faced it knowing they'd done the right thing.

They'd found something that mattered.

And they'd made sure it mattered to everyone.

That was worth any cost.
