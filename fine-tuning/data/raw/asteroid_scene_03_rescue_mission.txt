The mining laser cut through asteroid rock like butter. Captain Jax Torres watched the readouts, making sure Chen didn't push the equipment past safe limits.

"How much longer?" he asked.

"Three hours for this vein. Maybe four." Chen's voice crackled through the comm. "It's good ore, Cap. Nickel-iron with trace platinum. Should fetch decent prices."

"Good. We need decent." Jax pulled up their financial statements. Two months since the xenonite incident. They'd been working steadily, but debt repayment was slow. Every credit earned went to keeping the Falcon operational and paying off their loans.

Sofia Ruiz appeared on the bridge, carrying sample containers. "I've been analyzing the ore composition. There's something odd about the platinum concentrations."

"Good odd or bad odd?"

"Interesting odd. The platinum isn't evenly distributed—it's concentrated in veins, like it was deposited by hydrothermal processes."

"On an asteroid?"

"That's the weird part. Asteroids don't have hydrothermal systems. But this one shows geological patterns consistent with water circulation and chemical deposition." Sofia pulled up her analysis. "It's like this asteroid was once part of a larger body. Something that had liquid water and geological activity."

Jax considered the implications. "You're saying this could have been part of a planet?"

"Or a large moon. Something big enough to have internal heat and liquid water. Billions of years ago, before it was shattered." Sofia's eyes gleamed with scientific excitement. "This could be important for understanding early solar system formation."

"Can we sell that information?"

"Universities might pay for the data. Not much, but enough to justify the research time."

"Do it. Every credit helps."

Kayla Okonkwo's voice came through from the cockpit. "Cap, I'm picking up a distress signal. Weak, intermittent. About two hundred klicks spinward."

Jax felt his gut tighten. Distress signals in the belt usually meant trouble. But ignoring them was both illegal and immoral.

"Can you identify the source?"

"Small vessel. Registered to... let me check... independent prospector, name's Fortune's Favor. One person aboard."

"Play the signal."

Static filled the bridge, punctuated by a woman's voice. "—oxygen system failure. Emergency reserves at eighteen percent. Position is—" More static. "—request immediate assistance."

Eighteen percent oxygen. That gave them maybe six hours before she suffocated.

"Kayla, how long to reach her position?"

"Four hours at maximum burn. But Cap, that'll consume fuel we need for the return trip to the processing station."

The calculation was simple. Save someone's life, or save their profit margin.

Not really a choice at all.

"Plot intercept course. Chen, secure the mining operation. Sofia, prep the emergency medical kit. We're doing a rescue."

The Falcon burned hard toward the distress signal. Jax watched their fuel reserves tick downward, each percentage point representing credits they wouldn't earn this run.

Worth it. Had to be worth it.

They found the Fortune's Favor tumbling slowly, its attitude control obviously failed. The small prospector ship looked ancient—pre-war vintage, held together with patches and prayers.

"Life signs?" Jax asked.

"One occupant, alive but weakening. Oxygen at twelve percent now." Kayla maneuvered alongside the crippled ship. "Airlock looks functional. We can dock."

"Do it carefully. That hull looks fragile."

The docking process took thirty tense minutes. Finally, the magnetic clamps engaged and the airlock sealed.

Jax and Sofia entered the Fortune's Favor. The interior was cramped, dark, smelling of recycled air and desperation. They found the pilot in the cockpit, slumped over the controls.

She was young—maybe twenty-five—with close-cropped black hair and a face pale from oxygen deprivation.

Sofia checked vitals. "She's alive. Hypoxic but stable. We need to get her to our medical bay."

They carried her back to the Falcon. In their better-equipped medical bay, Sofia administered oxygen and monitored her recovery.

The pilot—her ID read Maya Santos—woke an hour later, gasping.

"Easy," Sofia said. "You're safe. We pulled you from your ship."

Santos's eyes focused slowly. "Fortune's Favor?"

"Adrift but intact. Your oxygen system failed. Do you remember what happened?"

"Regulator malfunction. I tried to fix it, but..." Santos sat up too fast, then fell back with a groan. "How bad is the damage?"

"We haven't done a full assessment yet," Jax said from the doorway. "But your ship is old. Might be more cost-effective to salvage than repair."

Santos's face crumpled. "That ship is all I have. It's my livelihood, my home. I can't afford a replacement."

"We'll figure something out." Jax pulled up her ship's registration. Independent operator, no corporate backing, mining license current but barely. "How long have you been working the belt?"

"Three years. Saved everything I had to buy the Fortune's Favor. She's not much, but she's mine." Santos looked at him with desperate eyes. "Or she was. If the oxygen system is gone, I'm done. Can't mine without life support."

Sofia glanced at Jax. He knew what she was thinking. They could help. Spare parts from their own supplies, Chen's mechanical skills, a few days of work.

It would cost them time and resources they couldn't afford.

But leaving Santos stranded would cost her everything.

"Chen," Jax called over the comm. "I need you to look at another ship's oxygen system. See if it's salvageable."

Chen evaluated the Fortune's Favor's life support with his characteristic thoroughness. When he reported back, his expression was grim.

"The oxygen regulator is completely fried. But that's not the real problem. The whole life support system is end-of-life. Patched and re-patched so many times I can't tell what's original and what's improvised." Chen pulled up diagrams. "I can get her breathing again with parts from our stores. But Cap, it'll fail again. Maybe in a week, maybe in a month. This ship is dying."

Santos was listening from the medical bay doorway. "How much to replace the whole system?"

"New? Forty thousand credits minimum. Used? Maybe twenty if you can find compatible components." Chen shook his head. "More than the ship is worth, honestly."

"So I'm done." Santos's voice was flat. "Three years of work, and I'm done."

Jax thought about his own struggles. The years working for Helios, watching his claims get stolen. The fight to buy the Falcon, to earn independence. The constant battle against corporations who had more resources, more lawyers, more everything.

Santos was him, three years ago. Just trying to survive in a system designed to crush small operators.

"Chen, can we use parts from our backup oxygen system?"

"We'd be flying without redundancy. One failure and we're in the same situation as her."

"Can we do it safely?"

Chen was quiet for a moment. "If we're careful. Test everything twice, maintain strict protocols. Yeah, we could do it. But Cap, it's a risk."

"So's everything in the belt." Jax turned to Santos. "We'll repair your system with our backup parts. Get you operational again. In exchange, you work with us for the next six months. We split profits sixty-forty, our favor. That covers the parts cost and gives you income to save for proper repairs."

Santos stared at him. "You'd do that? Risk your backup systems for a stranger?"

"I'd do that for another independent operator who got screwed by equipment failure and bad luck." Jax extended his hand. "Deal?"

Santos shook it, tears in her eyes. "Deal. Thank you. I don't... I don't know what to say."

"Say you'll pull your weight. We work hard on the Falcon. Everyone contributes."

"I can do that."

Over the next three days, Chen and Santos worked together to install the Falcon's backup oxygen system into the Fortune's Favor. Jax watched Santos learn Chen's techniques, saw her mechanical aptitude emerge.

She was good. Raw, but talented. The kind of engineer who could improvise solutions with limited resources.

The kind they needed.

"She's sharp," Chen told Jax privately. "Learns fast, doesn't make the same mistake twice. If she'd had proper training instead of learning by crisis, she'd be exceptional."

"Can we afford to keep her past six months?"

"Can we afford not to? Cap, our crew is stretched thin. Sofia's doing geology and medical. Kayla's flying and handling navigation and communications. I'm maintaining everything mechanical. We need more hands."

"We're barely profitable with four people."

"So we find bigger scores. Better asteroids. Sofia's planetary fragment theory—what if we could find more pieces? If this asteroid came from a shattered world, there might be others nearby. All with concentrated minerals from geological processes."

Jax considered it. Speculative mining was risky. But the potential payoff...

"Talk to Sofia. See if she can predict where other fragments might be. If we're taking on another crew member, we need to justify the expense."

Sofia and Santos spent the next week analyzing geological data. When they presented their findings, even Jax was impressed.

"We think the asteroid belt in this sector contains fragments from at least three different parent bodies," Sofia explained. "Based on mineral compositions and orbital mechanics, we can predict where clusters of similar fragments might be concentrated."

"How accurate are the predictions?"

"Sixty percent confidence on the general zones. Maybe thirty percent on specific asteroids." Sofia pulled up star charts marked with probability zones. "But those are better odds than random prospecting."

"And the valuable asteroids—the ones with concentrated minerals like platinum?"

"Should cluster in specific areas based on the parent body's original composition. If we can identify which parent body had the most valuable geological processes, we target fragments from that source."

Santos added, "I've been analyzing market data. Platinum prices are up forty percent this year. If we can find concentrated deposits—like the one we just mined—we could see triple our normal profit margins."

Jax looked at his crew. Chen nodding approval. Kayla studying the navigation implications. Sofia and Santos presenting their case with scientific rigor.

They were becoming something more than a desperate crew running from debt. They were becoming a team.

"Okay. We follow Sofia's predictions. Target high-probability zones for concentrated minerals. Santos, you're on probation for six months, then we revisit the partnership terms. Everyone clear?"

Affirmatives all around.

The Falcon set course for the first predicted cluster zone. Three days burn time, fuel consumption carefully calculated.

Santos fit into the crew faster than Jax expected. She bunked in the cargo bay—her choice, said she liked the space—and worked maintenance shifts with Chen. Her mechanical intuition was genuine. Within two weeks, she'd optimized three different systems without being asked.

The first high-probability asteroid was a bust. Standard composition, nothing special.

The second showed promise—elevated platinum concentrations, though not as dramatic as Sofia predicted.

The third was a winner. Platinum, iridium, and rare earth concentrations that made Jax's head spin. One asteroid worth more than everything they'd mined in the past year combined.

"How is this possible?" Kayla asked, staring at the assay results.

"Hydrothermal concentration over billions of years," Sofia said. "This fragment came from near the parent body's mantle-crust boundary. Perfect conditions for ore concentration."

"Can we claim the whole thing?"

Jax checked the size. "It's within standard claim limits. We file, we mine, we profit. For once, things are going our way."

They filed the claim and began mining operations. The work was hard—eighteen-hour days, all hands on deck. But profitable. For every ton of ore extracted, they were clearing triple their usual margins.

Santos proved invaluable. She could run the mining laser almost as well as Chen, freeing him for maintenance work. Her geological knowledge complemented Sofia's, helping identify the richest veins.

After two months, they'd extracted enough ore to pay off half their remaining debt. Another two months, and they'd be completely clear.

Free.

"I can't believe this is actually working," Kayla said one evening over dinner.

"Don't jinx it," Chen warned. "We're in the belt. Something will go wrong."

"Optimist," Santos teased.

"Realist. But I'll enjoy it while it lasts."

Jax watched his crew banter, feeling something like contentment. They'd started as desperate individuals running from corporate predators. They were becoming a family.

Not perfect. Not easy.

But theirs.

And in the harsh economics of the asteroid belt, that was worth more than any mineral deposit.

"Crew meeting tomorrow," Jax announced. "We need to discuss long-term plans. Once we're clear of debt, what's next? Keep mining? Expand operations? Invest in better equipment?"

"Democracy," Santos said. "I like it."

"More like oligarchy," Kayla corrected. "Jax still owns the ship."

"Benevolent oligarchy, then."

Jax smiled. "We'll figure it out together. Like everything else."

The Falcon rotated slowly in space, mining lasers carving wealth from ancient rock. Around them, the belt stretched infinite and hostile and full of possibility.

They'd found their place in it.

Not through luck. Through skill, determination, and the willingness to help others when the smart play would have been walking away.

Maya Santos was alive because they'd chosen compassion over profit.

And now they were all better off for it.

The mathematics of kindness, working out in their favor.

For once.

Jax would take it.

And build on it.

Because that's what you did in the belt.

Survived. Adapted. Helped when you could.

And hoped the universe noticed the effort.

Sometimes it did.

This was one of those times.
