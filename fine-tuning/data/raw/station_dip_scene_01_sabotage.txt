Ambassador Chen Wu watched the delegates arrive and wondered which one would try to kill him first.

Station Unity was neutral ground. A orbital platform where Earth's fractious factions negotiated instead of fighting. Usually. When negotiations failed, violence followed. Chen's job was preventing that failure.

Today's task: mediating between the European Federation and the Pacific Alliance. Two powers with overlapping territorial claims, competing resource interests, and a history of proxy conflicts.

Recipe for disaster.

"Ambassador." Station Director Kwame Nkrumah appeared at his side. "Both delegations are secured. Security sweeps came back clean."

"What about the station personnel?"

"Vetted and cleared. No affiliations with either faction."

Chen nodded. Clean probably meant nothing. Anyone determined enough could hide affiliations. But it was the best they could do.

The conference room was austere—white walls, minimal decoration. Deliberate design to avoid favoring any cultural aesthetic. Chen had negotiated in this room a hundred times. Some talks succeeded. Most just delayed inevitable conflict.

The European delegation entered first. Minister Larsson, flanked by advisors and security. Professional, cold, carrying the weight of a continent's interests.

The Pacific Alliance followed. Director Tan, also heavily guarded, also professional. The two delegations took opposite sides of the table without acknowledging each other.

Chen sat at the head. "Welcome to Station Unity. We're here to discuss the disputed mining rights in the asteroid belt, specifically the claims around Sector Seven-Beta."

"There's nothing to discuss," Larsson said. "Those claims are European, filed under proper treaty protocols."

"Filed after Pacific Alliance established operational presence," Tan countered. "Which under Outer Space Treaty Article Nine constitutes prior claim."

"Article Nine doesn't supersede Article Two. Celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation."

"Except when European interests are involved."

"Gentlemen." Chen's voice cut through the rising tension. "We're not here to rehash legal arguments. We're here to find practical solutions."

"The practical solution is European withdrawal," Tan said.

"The practical solution is Pacific Alliance recognition of filing precedence," Larsson shot back.

Chen pulled up the sector map. "Sector Seven-Beta contains approximately four hundred viable mining sites. Both factions are claiming the same seventy-three. What if we focus on division of the contested sites?"

"All or nothing," Larsson said. "We won't negotiate piecemeal concessions."

"Then we'll negotiate nothing, and the conflict escalates," Chen said. "Is that what you want?"

Neither delegate answered. But Chen saw the calculation in their eyes. How much was worth fighting over? How much could be compromised without losing face?

The negotiation ground through the afternoon. Chen proposed divisions. Both sides rejected them. Counter-proposals flew. Counter-counter-proposals. The elaborate dance of diplomacy where every concession was extracted like pulling teeth.

Four hours in, they'd agreed to divide twelve of the seventy-three contested sites. Progress measured in inches.

Chen called a recess. The delegations retreated to separate rooms. Chen found Director Nkrumah in the observation deck.

"How's it going?" Nkrumah asked.

"Like every negotiation. Slowly and painfully." Chen pulled up his notes. "They're posturing. Neither side actually wants war. But neither wants to look weak."

"So we're watching theater."

"Expensive, dangerous theater." Chen closed his tablet. "What's the security assessment?"

"Elevated alert. We've got increased chatter on encrypted channels. Someone's not happy about these talks."

"Which side?"

"Can't tell. Could be hardliners from either faction. Could be a third party who profits from conflict." Nkrumah pulled up the station's security grid. "I've got extra personnel on the conference level. Eyes on all entry points."

"Good. Let's—"

The explosion cut through the station like thunder.

Chen felt the deck lurch. Alarms screamed. Through the observation port, he saw debris venting from the station's lower ring.

"Report!" Nkrumah was already moving, pulling up damage control displays.

"Explosion in section twelve. Casualties unknown. Hull breach contained by emergency seals." Security Officer Lena Volkov's voice crackled through the comm. "Delegates are secure. We're in lockdown."

Chen activated his comm to the conference room. "This is Ambassador Wu. Both delegations remain in place. We have a security incident."

Larsson's voice: "What kind of incident?"

"Explosion. Details coming. Everyone stays put until we have situation under control."

He closed the channel and turned to Nkrumah. "Sabotage?"

"Looks like it. Too precise for accident." Nkrumah pulled up the security footage. A maintenance corridor, empty except for a technician in station uniform. Then white flash. Nothing.

"Who was that?" Chen asked.

"Running facial recognition." Nkrumah's expression darkened. "Got a match. Station personnel. Marcus Webb, life support maintenance. Been with us six months."

"Background check?"

"Clean. But obviously not clean enough."

Chen thought about the timing. Explosion during high-level negotiations. Someone wanted to disrupt the talks. Or blame one side for attacking the other.

"I need to know if Webb was working alone," Chen said. "And I need to know fast. If this escalates, we'll have war."

Volkov appeared in the observation deck, suit marked with soot. "Ambassador. Both delegations are demanding evacuation. Claiming the station's compromised."

"Station's secure," Nkrumah said. "One section damaged. Everything else nominal."

"They don't believe that. They think this was an attack by the other side."

Chen felt the situation spiraling. One explosion, and two delegations ready to blame each other. Perfect catalyst for conflict.

"Get me Dr. Okonkwo," he said.

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo arrived within minutes. The station's medical director looked exhausted—probably dealing with casualties from the explosion.

"How bad?" Chen asked.

"Three dead. Webb and two maintenance workers who were near the blast. Another five injured." Okonkwo pulled up casualty reports. "Could've been worse. If the explosion had breached the main hull instead of a maintenance corridor, we'd be looking at hundreds."

"Was it targeted?"

"Can't tell from medical. But the location suggests either incompetence or specific intent to minimize casualties."

Chen absorbed that. An explosion designed to make noise without killing everyone. A message, not a massacre.

"I need to address the delegations," he said.

Back in the conference room, both sides were on their feet. Security personnel from both factions had drawn weapons. The neutral meeting had become an armed standoff.

"Gentlemen. Weapons down. Now." Chen's voice carried authority he didn't feel.

Larsson's security chief didn't move. "We're leaving. The station's compromised."

"The station is secure. And you're not leaving until I have answers." Chen pulled up the security footage. "The explosion was caused by one of our maintenance personnel. Marcus Webb. He worked alone. No affiliation with either faction."

"Convenient," Tan said. "A lone actor who happens to attack during our negotiations."

"Not an attack. A disruption." Chen showed them the explosion analysis. "Webb planted the device in a maintenance corridor. Minimal casualties. Maximum noise. He wanted to disrupt the talks, not kill anyone."

"Why?" Larsson asked.

"That's what we're going to find out." Chen closed the display. "But right now, you both have a choice. Walk away and let whoever orchestrated this win. Or stay, finish the negotiation, and prove you won't be intimidated."

The delegations exchanged looks. Neither wanted to appear weak. Neither wanted to stay in a compromised station.

"Twenty-four hours," Chen said. "We investigate Webb's background. Find out who he was working for. And we complete this negotiation. Because walking away means someone else controls your decisions."

Tan was first to sit. "Twenty-four hours. But I want security tripled."

Larsson nodded slowly. "Agreed. And I want independent investigation into the bombing."

"Done," Nkrumah said. "My team will coordinate with both delegations' security. Full transparency."

The tension eased slightly. Chen activated a private channel to Volkov.

"Find out everything about Webb. Who he talked to. Who paid him. Who wanted these talks disrupted."

"On it."

The negotiations resumed. Slower, more cautious. But they resumed.

Chen watched the delegations argue over mining rights and thought about Webb. A station technician who'd passed every background check. Who'd waited six months before acting.

Someone was playing a longer game. And Chen needed to figure out who before they made their next move.

Because in space, sabotage didn't stop with one explosion.

It escalated until someone stopped it.

Or everyone died.
