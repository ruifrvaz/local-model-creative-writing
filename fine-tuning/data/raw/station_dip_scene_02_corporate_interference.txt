Ambassador Chen Wu found the listening device in his quarters at 0300. Standard surveillance tech. Corporate-grade. Someone was monitoring diplomatic communications.

He left it in place and made a call from a secured booth in the station's commercial district.

"Nkrumah, we have a problem."

Director Nkrumah met him twenty minutes later. Chen showed him the device schematics.

"This was planted in the last forty-eight hours. After the peace accord signing. Someone doesn't want the agreement to succeed."

"Corporate sabotage? Military intelligence?"

"Could be either. Could be both working together." Chen pulled up the device's transmission logs. "It's been broadcasting to a relay on the station's outer ring. I traced the relay to a dead-drop server. Whoever's receiving is good at covering their tracks."

"Can Volkov crack it?"

"She's our best chance." Chen handed over the data. "But we need to move carefully. If we tip our hand, the saboteurs go to ground."

Security Officer Volkov reviewed the evidence in her private office. The surveillance device was sophisticated—encrypted transmission, self-destruct protocol, designed to be nearly impossible to trace.

Nearly.

She followed the digital breadcrumbs. The relay server. The dead-drop accounts. Three layers of obfuscation that would've stopped most investigations.

Volkov wasn't most investigators.

The trail led to a station contractor. The same company that had employed Marcus Reeves—the saboteur from the previous attack. Different personnel, same corporate shell.

"They're persistent," Volkov reported to Nkrumah. "The contractor company is a front for intelligence operations. I'm seeing payment patterns consistent with corporate espionage networks."

"Which corporation?"

"That's the interesting part. The money comes from multiple sources. Consolidated Extraction, Stellar Defense Industries, at least three smaller contractors with defense ties." Volkov displayed the financial web. "They're all invested in conflict continuation. Peace costs them revenue."

Chen studied the pattern. "Defense contractors profit from military spending. Mining corps benefit from destabilized claim enforcement. They're allied against peace because peace hurts their bottom line."

"How do we counter that?" Nkrumah asked.

"By exposing it. Make the sabotage public. Show both Coalition and Alliance that they're being manipulated by corporate interests." Chen pulled up his diplomatic contacts. "I can get media coverage. Turn this into a scandal that's too big to ignore."

"That'll make us targets," Volkov warned.

"We're already targets. At least this way we're fighting back."

The story broke forty-eight hours later. Major network coverage. Evidence of corporate sabotage. Financial trails showing conflict profiteering. Names of executives who'd funded the operations.

The response was immediate and chaotic. Coalition and Alliance representatives demanded investigations. Corporate spokespeople denied everything. Media outlets picked apart the evidence, debating authenticity.

But the seed was planted. The peace process wasn't just diplomatic—it was economic threat to powerful interests.

Chen watched the coverage from his secured quarters. The listening device still in place, still transmitting. Let them hear him monitoring their exposure.

Three days after the story broke, someone tried to kill him.

The assassin was professional. Silent approach in the diplomatic quarter. Suppressed weapon. Clean shot.

Except Chen wasn't in his quarters. He'd anticipated the attempt and arranged a decoy.

Station security arrested the assassin—another contractor, this one with military training. Volkov's interrogation extracted little. The killer was loyal, well-paid, and legally shielded by corporate lawyers.

But the assassination attempt validated everything Chen had exposed.

"This confirms our evidence," Nkrumah announced at an emergency diplomatic session. "Corporate interests are actively trying to sabotage the peace process. Including assassination of neutral station personnel."

The Coalition and Alliance delegations were visibly shaken. This wasn't political maneuvering. This was violence against the diplomatic framework itself.

"We need unified response," Chen said. "Both sides publicly condemning corporate interference. Joint investigation with full transparency. Make it clear that the peace process won't be destroyed by profit motives."

Representative Sato spoke first. "The Coalition agrees. We'll cooperate fully with station security and provide our own intelligence resources."

Kowalski nodded. "The Alliance concurs. Whatever our differences, we don't tolerate assassination and sabotage."

The joint statement was released that evening. Strong language condemning corporate interference. Promise of coordinated investigation. Commitment to peace despite external pressures.

The corporate response was predictable. Denials. Legal threats. PR campaigns claiming the evidence was fabricated.

But public opinion shifted. The peace process had martyrs now. Chen, who'd survived assassination. The six killed in the initial bombing. The unknown number who'd died in conflicts that enriched corporate shareholders.

Support for the accord strengthened.

Volkov continued her investigation. She traced financial networks across a dozen shell companies. Identified twelve individuals with direct involvement in sabotage operations.

Most were untouchable—protected by corporate legal teams and political connections.

But three were vulnerable. Mid-level operatives without the legal protection of their superiors.

Volkov arrested them quietly. Offered deals. Testimony in exchange for reduced sentences.

Two refused. One accepted.

The testimony was damning. Detailed descriptions of sabotage operations. Names of corporate executives who'd ordered the attacks. Financial records showing payment flows.

Chen compiled it into a comprehensive brief. Legal evidence. Public record. Irrefutable documentation of corporate war profiteering.

The trial happened six months later. Public proceedings. Full media coverage. The Coalition and Alliance both provided prosecutors.

Verdicts came back guilty. The executives faced prison time. The contractor companies faced dissolution.

But the real victory wasn't legal. It was cultural.

The trial exposed how peace threatened certain economic interests. How profit motives could sabotage diplomatic progress. How corporate power operated outside governmental control.

And it galvanized support for the peace accord. Both Coalition and Alliance populations saw their conflicts as exploited by third parties. The anger redirected from each other toward the profiteers.

Chen attended the final peace accord signing—the comprehensive version that addressed economic integration, demilitarized zones, joint governance structures.

The ceremony was quiet. Professional. Representatives from both sides signing documents while cameras recorded.

No celebration. Too much damage. Too many dead. Too many years wasted.

But it was peace.

Imperfect. Fragile. Hard-won.

Nkrumah approached Chen after the signing. "You did good work. Made yourself a lot of enemies in the process."

"Enemies with reduced power. That's acceptable." Chen looked at the signed documents. "Think it'll last?"

"The accord? Maybe. The corporate interests will find new ways to profit from conflict." Nkrumah smiled slightly. "But we've shown that resistance is possible. That transparency can counter sabotage."

"A blueprint for future peace processes."

"Exactly."

Chen returned to his quarters. The listening device was gone—removed by station security weeks ago. His space was secure now. Private.

He sat at his desk and began writing. A comprehensive report on the peace process. Every sabotage attempt. Every corporate manipulation. Every lesson learned.

Document for future diplomats. Warning for future negotiations.

Proof that peace was possible even when powerful interests wanted war.

The report ran three hundred pages. Chen filed it with the diplomatic archive and the public record. Available to anyone who wanted to learn.

Outside his viewport, the station orbited. Neutral ground. Place where enemies could become negotiators.

Where peace could be built despite obstacles.

Chen closed his eyes. Exhausted. Battered. Alive.

The peace process had cost him. Cost everyone involved.

But it had succeeded.

And that was enough.
