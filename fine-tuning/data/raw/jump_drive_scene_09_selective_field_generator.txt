Dr. Kenji Yamamoto assembled the prototype selective field generator and tried not to think about what failure would mean. Three weeks of fabrication. Sixty components custom-built. Each one calibrated to picosecond precision.

One device that would either save Sarah Chen's life or fragment her body across incompatible timelines.

"Final integration checks complete," Dr. Hassan Patel reported. "Field coherence at ninety-nine point seven percent. Differential exposure parameters verified. We're as ready as we're going to be."

"Ninety-nine point seven isn't one hundred."

"One hundred doesn't exist in exotic physics. Too many variables. Too much quantum uncertainty." Hassan pulled up the simulation results. "Based on modeling, this should work. Should maintain high field intensity around Sarah's neural tissue while keeping body-wide exposure minimal."

"Should."

"Should is the best we ever get."

Kenji pulled up Sarah's latest medical scans. Her cellular temporal fragmentation had accelerated over the past three weeks. Heart tissue showing desynchronization. Liver cells aging at three different rates. Kidney function declining as different nephrons existed in different temporal states.

Without intervention, Dr. Mbara estimated two weeks before critical organ failure.

With intervention, they might save her. Or accelerate her fragmentation catastrophically.

"Bring her in."

Sarah arrived looking thinner than three weeks ago. The portable micro-field generator hummed on her back, sustaining her temporal consciousness while fragmenting her biology.

"Ready to play guinea pig again?" she asked.

"Ready to try saving your life."

"Same thing from different perspectives." Sarah studied the new generator. "This one's more complex. Multiple field emission nodes. Real-time adaptive control. You've been busy."

"We've been desperate." Kenji explained the device's function. "Differential field exposure. High intensity for your temporal processing centers, minimal for your body. Should stabilize cellular aging while maintaining consciousness."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Catastrophic cellular desynchronization. Potential organ failure across multiple temporal states simultaneously."

"So death, but complicated." Sarah nodded. "Let's do it."

Dr. Aisha Mbara entered with full medical monitoring equipment. "We're tracking every biological system in real-time. Any sign of catastrophic fragmentation, we shut down immediately."

"Immediate might not be fast enough if my heart decides to exist in three different moments simultaneously."

"Then we're very careful with the field parameters."

They positioned Sarah in the center of the new generator. It surrounded her like a cage of precisely aligned field emitters. Each node aimed at specific tissues. Each calibration verified three times.

Kenji's hand hovered over the activation control. Three weeks of work. Sarah's life. The future of FTL travel. All balanced on whether his calculations were correct.

"Activating in three, two, one."

The generator hummed to life. Different pitch than the portable unit. More complex. Multiple field harmonics creating interference patterns across Sarah's body.

Her neural monitors jumped.

"Temporal processing centers receiving full field exposure," Aisha reported. "Consciousness stable. Body tissues receiving—" She paused. "Receiving variable exposure. The differential is working. Neural tissue at high field intensity, cardiac tissue at twelve percent, liver at eight percent."

"Cellular response?"

"Monitoring. It takes time for cells to adjust to new field parameters."

They waited. Minutes stretched like hours. Kenji watched the field coherence readings, ready to shut down if anything drifted outside safe parameters.

Sarah sat perfectly still, eyes distant. Experiencing the field activation across multiple timeframes simultaneously. Feeling her cells respond in past, present, future all at once.

"Cellular temporal markers stabilizing," Emma Torres reported. "Heart tissue showing reduced desynchronization. Liver cells consolidating toward unified aging rate. The differential field is working."

Kenji felt something like hope. The generator was complex, expensive, power-hungry. But it worked. It was actually working.

"Neural processing stable?" he asked.

"Stable and fully supported. Sarah's consciousness is maintained while her body receives minimal temporal exposure." Aisha pulled up the full medical scan. "This is remarkable. We're selectively applying exotic physics to specific tissues."

Sarah opened her eyes. Blinked. The motion appeared more unified than before—less like multiple moments overlapping.

"It feels different. My body feels more... coherent. Like it's existing in fewer moments simultaneously."

"That's the goal. Reduce your biological temporal fragmentation while maintaining neural temporal processing."

"I can still perceive all moments. But my body is more anchored in the present." Sarah stood carefully. The new generator was stationary, its field range limited to three meters. "So I'm still tethered. Just to better equipment."

"For now. We're designing a portable version. But the power requirements are significant. The differential field control requires constant adaptive adjustment."

"How long can I stay in this field?"

"Indefinitely. The generator can run continuously as long as we have power. And given the military budget for FTL research, power isn't the limiting factor."

Sarah walked to the edge of the field range. At three meters, the differential exposure started degrading. Her cellular monitors showed increased temporal variance.

She stepped back into the optimal range. The fragmentation reduced immediately.

"So I have a three-meter cage now instead of total freedom."

"You have life instead of catastrophic organ failure," Aisha said. "I'll take the cage."

Sarah was quiet for a moment. Experiencing the trade-off across multiple temporal perspectives simultaneously. Freedom versus survival. Independence versus necessity.

"You're right. Survival first. Freedom later." She settled into a chair positioned at the field's center. "How long before the portable version?"

"Six months. Maybe eight. The miniaturization is complex."

"Then I have six months of being a lab resident. Could be worse."

They set up a living space within the field range. Bed, desk, personal items. A three-meter radius of normalcy inside a cage of exotic physics.

Sarah adapted with the same determination she'd shown volunteering for the first jump. She existed across all moments simultaneously, but her body was stable now. Coherent. Not fragmenting.

Kenji visited daily to monitor the generator. The device required constant calibration. Small adjustments to field parameters. Real-time adaptation to Sarah's changing biology.

"You're getting good at this," she said one afternoon while he adjusted the emission nodes.

"Practice. You're a complex patient."

"I'm a prototype. First human to live permanently in differential temporal fields. First person to require exotic physics just to exist coherently."

"You're also the person who solved FTL navigation. That matters."

"Does it? We have perfect navigation now. But every pilot who makes multiple jumps risks temporal fragmentation. I solved the technical problem and created a biological one."

Kenji pulled up the latest research data. "We're working on neural shielding. Ways to protect pilots from temporal effects during jump transition. Your experience is teaching us how to prevent future fragmentation."

"So my suffering has scientific value."

"Your sacrifice has scientific value. There's a difference."

Sarah was quiet. Experiencing his words across multiple moments. Past validation, present gratitude, future vindication.

"The volunteer pilots," she said eventually. "Have they started jumping?"

"First test jumps scheduled for next month. Improved shielding. Better medical monitoring. Refined field protocols. We're trying to prevent what happened to you."

"Will it work?"

"I don't know. Physics is complicated. Neurology is complicated. The intersection is chaos."

"That's honest, at least." Sarah pulled up her personal files. "I wrote letters. To each volunteer. Explaining what temporal fragmentation actually feels like. What they're risking. They need to understand before they jump."

"Admiral Kowalski already briefed them."

"Kowalski briefed them on strategic necessity and technological achievement. I'm briefing them on what it feels like when your consciousness exists across all moments simultaneously. When your body starts fragmenting. When your sense of causality becomes negotiable."

She showed him the letters. Detailed. Unflinching. Honest about the costs.

"These might scare them away."

"Good. They should be scared. Fear is appropriate for what we're doing." Sarah sent the files to his terminal. "Make sure they get these. Before they jump. Everyone deserves to make informed choices."

Kenji read through the letters. They were brutal. Beautiful. Completely Sarah—precise, technical, emotionally honest about experiencing consciousness across incompatible timeframes.

"I'll make sure they get them."

"Thank you."

The generator hummed its constant song. Sarah existed within its field, tethered to three meters of stability. Her consciousness scattered across all moments. Her body held together by exotic physics.

But alive. Functional. Contributing to humanity's expansion into faster-than-light travel.

The volunteers would read her letters. Some would withdraw. Some would proceed, eyes open to the risks.

And humanity would continue pushing boundaries. Paying costs. Adapting to physics that challenged everything about human experience.

Sarah had been first. Others would follow.

The question was whether they'd survive as coherently as she had.

Time would tell.

Sarah already knew. She existed across all moments, perceiving probable futures.

She just wasn't telling anyone which futures were most likely.

Some knowledge was too heavy to share.

Even for someone experiencing all burdens simultaneously.
