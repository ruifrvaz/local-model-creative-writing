Dr. Eva Sato watched the scout ship's beacon and counted the days until answers arrived.

Three years. James Okoye and his team investigating the planet. Three years of waiting while Perseverance continued its slow journey toward Kepler-442b.

The beacon transmitted regularly. Automated updates. Life signs normal. Research progressing. But no detailed findings. No recommendation about whether the planet could save them.

"Any word?" Malik appeared beside her in the observation dome.

"Just the beacon. Same as always."

"They're overdue for detailed report."

"By two weeks. But that could mean anything. Technical difficulties. Extended research. Or they found something that requires more study."

Malik pulled up the ship's trajectory. "We're approaching the point of no return. Another three weeks and we won't have fuel to decelerate and turn back."

Eva knew. She'd been watching the countdown. The moment when continuing forward became the only option.

"Captain Reyes will make the decision," Eva said.

"Based on what? We don't have the scout team's findings."

"Based on the ship's needs. The genetics. The resource projections. Whether we can complete the voyage."

"We can. If we implement the conservation measures."

"If everyone agrees to them. If morale holds. If no critical systems fail." Eva pulled up the population projections. "We're gambling that two hundred more years won't break us."

"Every generation ship is a gamble."

"Most don't find unexpected planets halfway through."

They watched the stars in silence. Eva thought about the vote. Eighteen to fifteen for continuing. Barely a majority. Half the ship wanted to turn back.

And now the decision was being made by calendar. By fuel consumption. By physics that didn't care about democracy.

"What will you do?" Malik asked. "If Reyes decides to continue?"

"Accept it. Do my job. Preserve Earth's culture for people who might never see Earth."

"You sound resigned."

"I'm a historian. I understand that some decisions are made by circumstances, not choices. We're past the point where individual preference matters. The mission has momentum."

Malik was quiet for a moment. "I used to think the mission was sacred. That completing it mattered more than anything. But the genetics reports... Maybe we're being stubborn instead of dedicated."

"You're doubting?"

"I'm questioning. Which my grandfather would say is weakness. But I think it might be wisdom."

Eva felt something shift. Malik had been the mission's strongest advocate. If he was questioning, the consensus was fragmenting.

"What changed?" she asked.

"I did math. Real math, not hopeful projections. We're declining faster than the models predicted. Another two hundred years might get us to Kepler-442b with a population too damaged to colonize. We'd have completed the mission but lost the people."

"So you think we should turn back?"

"I think we should have data before we make irreversible decisions. And we don't have it." Malik pulled up the scout beacon. "James is out there with answers. We're here making choices in ignorance."

The observation dome's comm chimed. Captain Reyes's voice: "Senior staff to the conference room. Immediate briefing."

They assembled within minutes. The captain looked exhausted. Three years of divided ship. Three years of delayed decision. Three years of waiting for information that never came.

"The scout team beacon just transmitted a detailed report," Reyes said. "I'm sharing it now."

The files populated on everyone's tablets. Planetary assessment. Atmospheric analysis. Biological surveys. James's recommendations.

Eva read through the data. The planet was habitable. Marginally. Temperature extremes. Atmospheric chemistry that would require adaptation. Gravity slightly higher than Earth standard.

Not perfect. But survivable.

James's conclusion: "The planet represents acceptable risk for colonization. Genetic diversity would benefit from introduction to novel environment. Recommend evaluation for settlement."

"He's saying we should turn back," Eva said.

"He's saying it's viable," Malik corrected. "Not ideal. But possible."

Reyes pulled up the fuel projections. "We have seventy-two hours before point of no return. I'm calling for vote. Full ship assembly. Everyone gets voice."

"That's three thousand people," someone said. "It'll take days."

"Then we work fast. This decision affects everyone. Everyone should participate."

The assembly took forty-eight hours. Every section of the ship. Every age group. Every faction and perspective.

The vote was close. One thousand six hundred forty-seven for turning back. One thousand three hundred fifty-three for continuing.

A majority. Barely.

Reyes stood before the assembled crew. "The vote is clear. We turn back. We settle the planet James investigated. We complete a different mission than we planned, but we complete it alive."

Applause from those who'd voted for return. Silence from those who'd wanted to continue.

Malik stood. "I voted for continuing. But I accept the decision. We're still a mission. Just a different one than our ancestors planned."

Eva felt tears on her face. Relief. Grief. The complex emotion of choosing survival over tradition.

The ship's engines fired. Deceleration burn. Changing vector. Turning back toward the planet they'd passed three years ago.

The mission was over. Two hundred and four years of travel. Ten generations. Countless sacrifices.

Ending not at Kepler-442b, but at an unnamed world that might become humanity's new home.

Eva pulled up the cultural archives. Everything Earth had sent with them. Music, art, literature, history. All preserved for a colony that would start on a different world than planned.

She started updating the records. "Mission log addendum. Year two hundred and four. Perseverance has changed course. New destination: planetary system designated Scout-Alpha. Mission parameters adapted to reflect new settlement goal. The dream of Kepler-442b remains unfulfilled, but the dream of human expansion continues."

Eva saved the log and thought about the original mission planners. Whether they'd approve or be disappointed. Whether dedication to the plan mattered more than survival of the people.

She decided it didn't matter. They were dead. The living got to make the choice.

And they'd chosen life over legacy.

That was enough.

Eva returned to the observation dome. Watched the ship's new trajectory. Toward a planet James had investigated. Toward uncertainty and possibility.

Toward home.

Whatever that meant now.

The ship turned. The mission adapted. Humanity continued.

That was the real victory.

Not in reaching a specific destination.

But in surviving long enough to choose a new one.
