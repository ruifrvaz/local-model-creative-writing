The docking clamps engaged with a metallic thud that resonated through Unity Station's hull. Ambassador Chen Wu watched through the observation port as the Earth Coalition transport settled into berth seven, its white and blue insignia stark against the station's gunmetal gray.

"They're early," Kwame Nkrumah said, his voice neutral but his jaw tight.

Chen checked his tablet. "Forty-seven minutes early. Typical Coalition efficiency." Or a power play. Hard to tell which.

The station director stood with his arms crossed, watching the umbilical extend toward the transport's airlock. Unity Station was his domain—a neutral zone in the shipping lanes between Earth and the outer colonies. No flags, no allegiances, just commerce and the occasional diplomatic meeting when tensions needed managing.

This wasn't occasional. This was critical.

"The Mars delegation arrives in six hours," Kwame said. "I want both parties settled in separate sections before anyone starts talking. Or shooting."

"The Coalition won't start anything aboard a neutral station."

"You believe that?"

Chen didn't answer immediately. He'd spent fifteen years in diplomatic service, ten of them navigating the widening rift between Earth and the colonies. Words like "neutral" and "peaceful" had become relative terms.

"I believe they understand the value of appearances," he said finally.

Kwame's expression suggested he found that distinction meaningless.

The airlock cycled. Chen watched the pressure indicators stabilize, then straighten his jacket. First impressions mattered, especially when the alternative to diplomacy was a war neither side could afford but both seemed determined to pursue.

"Security arrangements?" he asked.

"Lena's team has eyes on every corridor. Weapons scanners at each checkpoint, biometric tracking, surveillance on all public areas." Kwame pulled up a schematic on his wrist display. "I've assigned Coalition delegates to section four, Mars to section nine. Conference rooms are in section six, equidistant from both."

"Medical facilities?"

"Dr. Okonkwo is prepping trauma bays just in case. She's not happy about it."

"Nobody's happy about any of this." Chen moved toward the airlock entrance. "That's why we're here instead of letting Fleet admirals handle negotiations."

The inner door opened. A woman in Coalition gray stepped through, flanked by four security officers in body armor. Her hair was pulled back severe enough to make Chen's scalp ache in sympathy, and her eyes scanned the reception area with the efficiency of someone cataloging threats.

"Ambassador Chen Wu," she said, extending a hand. "Director Sarah Kim, Coalition External Relations. Thank you for hosting these talks."

Her handshake was exactly firm enough to convey competence without aggression. Chen recognized the technique—he'd taught it to junior diplomats.

"Director Kim. Welcome to Unity Station." He gestured to Kwame. "Station Director Nkrumah oversees all facilities here. We've prepared quarters for your delegation in section four."

"I'd prefer section six. Closer to the conference rooms."

"Section six is neutral territory during negotiations. Both delegations will have equal travel time." Kwame's tone was polite but inflexible. "Station regulations."

Kim considered him for three seconds. Then nodded. "Understood. We'll comply with local protocols."

Her security team moved in formation behind her as they walked. Chen noted the way they positioned themselves—overlapping fields of fire, constant awareness of exits, hands never far from sidearms.

"Your team seems well-prepared," he observed.

"There have been threats," Kim said. "Extremist elements on both sides oppose these negotiations. We take security seriously."

"As do we. Station security will coordinate with your team, but primary jurisdiction rests with Unity personnel. Director Nkrumah has final authority on all matters of station safety."

Kim's expression flickered—irritation, quickly suppressed. "Of course."

They reached section four. The quarters were comfortable but not luxurious—private sleeping pods, a common area, secured communication facilities. Coalition standard, which was either neutral or insulting depending on perspective.

"The Mars delegation arrives at 1800 hours," Chen said. "We'll convene preliminary discussions tomorrow morning at 0900. Tonight is for settling in and reviewing protocols."

"I'd like to inspect the conference facilities."

"I'll have Station Director Nkrumah arrange a tour." Chen pulled up his schedule. "I'll meet with both delegations separately this evening. Seven o'clock for Coalition, eight-thirty for Mars."

"Separate meetings." Kim's tone was carefully neutral. "You're not starting with joint sessions?"

"Not until I understand what each side actually wants versus what they're willing to say in public." Chen met her eyes. "These negotiations work, or people die. I'm not interested in performance. I want results."

Kim studied him. "You're more direct than your reputation suggested."

"My reputation is based on what I let other people see. You're getting honesty because I need you to understand the stakes." Chen checked his tablet. "Four outer colony stations are at operational readiness. Coalition fleet movements suggest mobilization plans. If these talks fail, we're looking at open conflict within three months."

"Then we better make sure they succeed."

"Agreed." Chen gestured to the communications terminal. "Secure line to Earth, if you need it. All conversations are private—Unity monitors for technical issues only, no content surveillance."

"You trust that?"

"I trust Kwame Nkrumah's obsession with neutrality more than I trust most governments' promises." Chen moved toward the door. "Get settled. Dinner is available in the common area or delivered to quarters. I'll see you at seven."

He left before Kim could ask more questions. In the corridor, Kwame was waiting with a grim expression.

"Mars transport just updated their ETA," the station director said. "They're arriving two hours early now."

Chen felt tension settle between his shoulder blades. "Matching Coalition's move."

"Or they were always planning to come early and just got outmaneuvered." Kwame pulled up the docking schedule. "Either way, both delegations will be aboard before we wanted them. More time to discover things we'd prefer they didn't know about each other."

"How long can you keep them separated?"

"As long as I want. This is my station." Kwame's expression hardened. "But keeping them apart isn't the same as keeping them peaceful. Lena's already monitoring six different communication channels that appeared in the last hour. Encrypted, bouncing through relay stations, but definitely originating from one delegation or the other."

"Talking to whom?"

"That's what worries me. We don't know yet."

Chen walked toward his office, mind already calculating scenarios. Early arrivals. Secret communications. Security teams on edge. The pieces of a crisis were assembling themselves, and the negotiations hadn't even started.

This was going to be worse than he'd thought.

And he'd thought it was going to be bad.
