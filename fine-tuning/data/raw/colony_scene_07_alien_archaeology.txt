Hassan's drill hit something unexpected at forty meters down. Not water this time. Something solid.

Metal.

He pulled the core sample carefully, his hands shaking slightly. The cylinder contained regolith, ice, and embedded in the lower section, a piece of worked metal. Not meteor iron. Not natural formation.

Manufactured.

Alexis arrived at the drill site within twenty minutes of his call. She took one look at the sample and went pale.

"That's a hull fragment. Composite alloy, radiation shielding characteristics. Hassan, that's from a spacecraft."

"Forty meters down. Which means it's been here for..."

"At least a hundred thousand years. Maybe more." Alexis ran spectroscopic analysis. "The alloy composition doesn't match anything in our databases. It's not human."

They stared at each other.

"We just found evidence of alien visitation," Hassan said quietly.

"Or alien crash landing." Alexis pulled up geological surveys. "We need to know how much more is down there. If this is just debris or if there's an intact structure."

"And we need to decide whether to report this to Earth corporate."

"Why wouldn't we?"

"Because Earth corporate will classify it immediately. Send their own research teams. Cut us out entirely." Hassan gestured at the sample. "This is the most significant archaeological discovery in human history. Do we really want them to control it?"

Alexis thought about the independence discussions. About Mars's future. About what it would mean to have evidence of alien civilization under their feet.

"We document everything ourselves first," she decided. "Full survey, complete analysis. Then we report. But we make sure the data is public before corporate can bury it."

They worked in secret for two weeks. Expanded the drill site, extracted more samples, mapped the subsurface structure with ground-penetrating radar.

What they found took their breath away.

Not just debris. An intact vessel. Buried under forty meters of Martian soil and ice. Roughly cylindrical, thirty meters long, composition unlike anything human technology produced.

And old. Carbon dating of organic material trapped in the ice suggested one hundred forty thousand years since burial.

"How do we proceed?" Hassan asked. "Do we try to excavate?"

"We don't have the resources for that. And disturbing it could damage it irreparably." Alexis pulled up archaeological protocols. "We document the site. Create complete scans. Then we bring in experts."

"Earth experts or Mars experts?"

"Both. This is too important for politics." Alexis began compiling the data package. "But Hassan, we release the information simultaneously to Earth and to every Mars colony. Make it impossible to suppress."

"Rivera's going to love that."

Commander Rivera didn't love it. But she didn't forbid it either.

"You're starting an international incident," she told them. "Multiple governments will claim jurisdiction. Corporate interests will demand access. This could trigger conflicts we're not prepared to handle."

"Or it could unite humanity around shared heritage," Alexis countered. "We're not alone in the universe. We never were. That changes everything."

"Maybe. Or it just creates new reasons to fight." Rivera studied the scans. "I'll support your decision to publish. But Alexis, be prepared for consequences. This will bring attention Mars hasn't seen before. Not all of it friendly."

The data release happened at midnight Greenwich time. Simultaneously broadcast to Earth Command, Martian Coordination Council, major universities, and public scientific databases.

Evidence of alien spacecraft buried on Mars. Complete scans, analysis, and coordinates.

The response was immediate and overwhelming.

Earth governments demanded exclusive access. Mars colonies claimed sovereign rights. Corporate entities filed for extraction permits. Scientists screamed for preservation and careful study.

And conspiracy theorists went absolutely wild.

Alexis watched the chaos unfold from her office, feeling both exhilarated and terrified.

"We just changed history," Hassan said, joining her.

"For better or worse."

"Time will tell. But Alexis, we did it right. Made the information public. Prevented any single entity from controlling it."

"At the cost of making ourselves targets. Every power broker in the solar system now knows our names."

"Fame has a price." Hassan pulled up messages. "Already getting offers. Universities want us to lead excavation efforts. Governments want us to testify. Media wants interviews."

"And Earth corporate?"

"Surprisingly quiet. Which worries me more than loud threats."

It should. Silence from corporate usually meant they were planning something.

The first diplomatic team arrived three days later. United Nations Special Committee on Extraterrestrial Artifacts. They were polite, professional, and absolutely determined to take control of the site.

"This discovery has implications for all humanity," the lead diplomat explained. "It needs to be managed at the international level."

"It's on Mars," Alexis countered. "Under Martian soil. Shouldn't Mars have a voice in how it's handled?"

"Mars is Earth territory. Under corporate charter agreements, any discoveries revert to Earth jurisdiction."

"That's colonial law. Written by corporations to exploit colonists."

"It's still law." The diplomat's voice hardened. "Ms. Kwan, we can do this cooperatively or through legal enforcement. Your choice."

Rivera intervened before Alexis could say something career-ending.

"We'll cooperate. But Mars expects full participation in any research effort. This isn't Earth's discovery. It's ours. We found it, we documented it, we shared it. We deserve recognition and involvement."

After days of negotiation, they reached a compromise. Joint Earth-Mars research team. Shared data access. Credit given to Hassan and Alexis as primary discoverers.

It wasn't perfect. But it was something.

The excavation began three months later. Carefully. Painstakingly. Every layer of soil documented, every artifact preserved.

The ship was indeed alien. Its design principles were unfamiliar. Its materials were advanced beyond current human technology.

And inside, they found remains.

Not human. Definitely not human. Skeletal structure suggested bipedal locomotion, but the proportions were all wrong. Limb count didn't match. Skull structure was radically different.

Aliens. Real, physical proof that intelligence had evolved elsewhere.

And they'd visited Mars. Long before humans ever dreamed of space travel.

"Why were they here?" Hassan wondered, studying the remains.

"Maybe exploring. Maybe colonizing. Maybe running from something." Alexis looked at the ancient ship. "They came from the stars. Just like we're trying to do now."

"Did they make it home?"

"Unknown. This might be wreckage from a larger fleet. Or it might be all that's left of their civilization."

A sobering thought. An entire species reduced to bones in a crashed ship.

"We should learn from them," Hassan said. "Whatever drove them to the stars, whatever challenges they faced. We're following the same path. We should understand their mistakes."

"If we can. Forty thousand years is a long time. Context is lost."

"But not everything. We can study their technology, their biology, their path through space. Learn from their successes and their failures."

The alien ship became a symbol. For some, proof that humanity should reach for the stars. For others, warning about the dangers of space exploration.

For Alexis and Hassan, it was simpler.

Evidence that the universe was bigger, stranger, more full of possibility than anyone imagined.

And Mars—their Mars—was part of that grand story.

Not just a colony. Not just a staging ground for human expansion.

A place where species met across unimaginable gulfs of time.

A crossroads in the cosmos.

And they were privileged to live there.

To discover its secrets.

To add their chapter to a story that stretched across millennia.

Alexis stood at the excavation site, watching archaeologists carefully extract alien artifacts.

Hassan joined her, holding a small piece of alien metal.

"Think they knew?" he asked. "That someday, another species would find them?"

"Maybe. Maybe that's why they came. Looking for others. Like we are."

"Then we should honor that. Keep looking. Keep reaching. Keep trying to connect across the void."

"We will. That's what humans do."

"That's what conscious beings do. We seek each other across the dark."

Alexis took the metal fragment, feeling its alien texture.

Evidence of kinship across the stars.

Proof that the urge to explore, to connect, to understand was universal.

And Mars would be part of that story.

Forever.
