Dr. Omar Hassan knelt in the tunnel, his headlamp cutting through darkness that pressed like physical weight. The drill sat silent beside him.

He'd found something. Something that shouldn't exist.

His gloved hand touched the exposed rock face. The subsurface scanner had detected an anomaly three meters down—a void where solid regolith should be. Hassan had spent six hours excavating, convinced the equipment was malfunctioning.

The equipment wasn't malfunctioning.

His fingers traced the edge of the cavity. Smooth. Too smooth for natural formation. The walls showed no signs of erosion, no fracture patterns consistent with gas pockets or ancient lava tubes.

Someone—or something—had carved this space deliberately.

Hassan activated his comm. "Kwan, you need to see this."

Static. The tunnel ran deep enough that the relay might not reach.

He pulled out his geological scanner and aimed it into the darkness beyond the cavity's entrance. The readings made no sense. Empty space extending at least twenty meters. Temperature differential suggesting air flow, which was impossible this far underground.

Mars had no atmosphere worth mentioning, and definitely not in sealed cavities below the surface.

Hassan clipped a safety line to his harness and crawled into the opening. The cavity widened after two meters, and suddenly he could stand. His headlamp swept across walls that curved with mathematical precision.

Not natural. Absolutely not natural.

The chamber was roughly spherical, maybe thirty meters in diameter. The walls bore markings—geometric patterns etched into stone. Hassan approached the nearest section and ran his scanner along the grooves.

Carbon scoring. Recent, geologically speaking. Within the last few thousand years.

His pulse hammered. Mars had been dead for millions of years. No volcanic activity. No tectonic shifts. Nothing that could explain fresh carbon deposits in a perfectly spherical underground chamber.

He photographed everything. The patterns. The wall composition. The strange regularity of the chamber's dimensions. Then he noticed something else.

The floor wasn't level. It sloped toward the center, where a circular depression suggested something had once occupied the space.

Hassan knelt beside the depression and scraped a sample into a collection tube. The material felt wrong—too uniform, almost artificial. He'd need spectral analysis to be sure, but his instincts screamed that this wasn't natural regolith.

His comm crackled. "—assan, respond. Hassan, do you copy?"

"I'm here." He moved toward better reception. "Alexis, get down here. Bring Rivera if she's available."

"What did you find?"

"I don't know. But it's not geological."

Silence. Then: "Say again?"

"The anomaly isn't natural. Someone built this."

"That's impossible."

"I know. Come anyway."

He returned to the chamber while he waited. The geometric patterns repeated across the walls—circles intersecting with lines, spirals that suggested mathematical sequences. Hassan had studied ancient human architecture. These markings shared principles with sacred geometry found in Earth structures spanning millennia.

But this was Mars. Dead Mars. Lifeless Mars.

Except something had been here.

Footsteps echoed in the tunnel. Alexis appeared first, followed by Commander Rivera. Both stopped when their lights revealed the chamber.

"Holy shit," Alexis breathed.

Rivera stepped forward slowly, her expression unreadable. "Doctor Hassan, tell me you didn't fabricate this."

"I wish I had." He gestured to the walls. "Carbon scoring suggests activity within the last five thousand years. The chamber's geometry is too precise for natural formation. And look at this."

He showed them the central depression. "Something was here. Something was installed or stored here. And then it was removed."

Rivera circled the space, her hand resting on her sidearm out of habit. "Any sign of current activity?"

"None. The chamber's been empty for centuries at minimum, possibly longer."

"But something was here," Alexis said quietly. "Something intelligent enough to carve underground chambers and mark them with symbols."

"I need to report this to Earth," Rivera said.

Hassan nodded. "I recommend sealing the tunnel until we can organize a proper archaeological survey."

"Agreed." Rivera took her own photographs. "This changes everything. If Mars had indigenous life—"

"Or visitors," Alexis interrupted.

They looked at each other. The implications hung unspoken.

Hassan had spent his career studying Mars's geological history. The planet's death had been slow—atmosphere stripped by solar wind, water locked into permafrost, volcanic activity cooling until nothing remained but red dust and ancient stone.

But what if the death hadn't been complete? What if something had survived, or visited, or waited?

"We keep this contained," Rivera said. "Need-to-know only until Earth responds. Hassan, I want full documentation. Spectral analysis, carbon dating, structural assessment. Treat this like first contact protocol."

"Because it might be," Hassan said.

"Because it is." Rivera headed for the exit. "Even if they're long gone, something was here. And we need to know what, and why, and whether it's coming back."

After they left, Hassan remained in the chamber. He sat on the smooth floor and turned off his headlamp.

Darkness swallowed everything. Pure. Complete. The kind of darkness that existed before stars.

Then his eyes adjusted, and he saw something impossible.

Faint phosphorescence in the walls. Barely visible. Pulsing with rhythm that suggested not chemistry but purpose.

Hassan turned his lamp back on. The glow vanished instantly.

Off again. And there it was—gentle light dancing through the stone, following the geometric patterns like electricity through circuits.

He should report this immediately. Should follow protocol and document everything.

Instead, he sat in the dark and watched Mars whisper secrets in light.

Whatever had built this chamber, part of it still remained.

Waiting.

And for the first time since arriving on Mars, Hassan wondered if humanity's colony was alone on this world.

Or if they'd just moved into someone else's home.
