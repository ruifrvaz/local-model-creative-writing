The jump sickness hit Chen harder than usual. She vomited three times before the temporal disorientation settled.

Dr. Mbara was waiting with the usual post-jump medications. "Your cellular aging is accelerating again. Fourteen hours this jump. That's worse than the previous three."

"I felt the difference." Chen's hands shook as she disconnected from the interface. "The drive geometry felt... off. Like something was fighting the field stability."

"Did you report it during the jump?"

"It happened too fast. One moment smooth navigation, next moment temporal shear spiking. I compensated, but it cost me."

Mbara ran comprehensive scans. "Your telomeres are showing severe degradation. Another ten jumps like this and we're looking at serious age-related complications."

"Yamamoto needs to know about the field instability."

They found him in the drive engineering bay, reviewing the jump data logs.

"I saw the anomaly," Yamamoto said before they could report. "Drive performance was within parameters, but the Alcubierre field showed harmonic oscillations we haven't seen before."

"What causes that?" Chen asked.

"Unknown. Could be subspace density fluctuations. Could be quantum foam turbulence. Could be cumulative stress on the field generators from repeated jumps." Yamamoto pulled up the diagnostic readout. "We've been pushing this prototype hard. Six months of testing. Sixty-eight jumps. The hardware might be fatiguing."

"Can you fix it?"

"I can recalibrate. Replace some components. But Chen, the fundamental issue isn't the drive. It's the human interface. Your neural connection to the field geometry—that's where the instability originates."

"You're saying I'm the problem?"

"I'm saying human consciousness interacting with spacetime manipulation creates unpredictable feedback. The better you get at navigation, the more your mind influences the field. And that influence destabilizes the geometry."

Chen sat down heavily. "So I'm causing my own aging acceleration."

"In a sense. Your improved skill creates stronger neural resonance with the drive. That resonance introduces quantum uncertainty. The uncertainty manifests as temporal shear." Yamamoto looked sympathetic. "You're too good at this job. Your expertise is the liability."

"That's paradoxical."

"Welcome to FTL physics. Paradox is the baseline."

Chen studied the jump logs. The pattern was clear. Her early jumps—clumsy but safe. Her recent jumps—precise but costly. Excellence came at a price measured in biological years.

"What are my options?" she asked.

"Reduce jump frequency. Limit neural interface intensity. Accept higher navigation drift in exchange for lower biological cost." Yamamoto pulled up alternative protocols. "Or we find new pilots. Distribute the load across multiple people. Prevent any single individual from accumulating excessive exposure."

"We tried that. New pilots show worse performance."

"Because you've set the standard. Everyone's trying to match your results." Yamamoto smiled slightly. "You're a victim of your own success."

Admiral Kowalski joined the meeting an hour later. Chen presented the data—degrading biological metrics, field instability, the trade-off between performance and survival.

"We need to make a decision," Kowalski said. "Continue pushing for optimal performance or accept reduced capability in favor of pilot longevity."

"We have FTL travel," Chen said. "That's the breakthrough. Whether I navigate with zero drift or point-one drift doesn't change the fundamental achievement."

"It changes deployment viability. Fleet Command wants precision. They want reliable navigation across strategic distances."

"Fleet Command wants miracles. I'm giving them physics." Chen pulled up her biological reports. "I can make another twenty jumps. Maybe thirty if we reduce frequency and accept drift. Then I'm done. My body won't sustain further exposure."

"Then we train replacements. Aggressively. Multiple pilots cycling through to prevent any single individual from bearing excessive load."

"That takes time we might not have."

Kowalski studied her. "You want to keep jumping. Despite the cost."

Chen wanted to deny it. But she couldn't. The jumps were addictive. The sensation of existing across light-years. The temporal non-existence that was terrifying and profound.

"Yes," she admitted. "But I recognize that's not sustainable. We need the program to outlive my participation."

"Agreed. But we also need your expertise for training." Kowalski made the decision. "You're grounded. Effective immediately. New role: chief instructor for FTL navigation. You'll train the next generation of pilots."

Chen felt relief and loss in equal measure. No more jumps. No more temporal dislocation. No more aging herself out of her own timeline.

But also no more crossing light-years in the blink of an eye. No more experiencing the universe in ways no human had before.

"Understood, sir. I'll begin developing training curricula."

The transition was harder than she'd expected. Watching new pilots prep for jumps while she remained grounded. Monitoring their performance from observation decks instead of experiencing it directly.

But she was good at teaching. Better than she'd anticipated.

Ensign Kioko became her star student. Natural aptitude for spatial-temporal thinking. Comfortable with the neural interface. Willing to push boundaries.

Too willing, sometimes.

"You're taking unnecessary risks," Chen told her after a particularly aggressive jump. "The drift was zero but your cellular aging was eighteen hours. That's not sustainable."

"You achieved zero drift regularly," Kioko countered.

"And aged myself forty weeks in eight months. Don't replicate my mistakes." Chen pulled up the long-term health projections. "You want a career spanning decades? You moderate your approach. Accept small imperfections to preserve longevity."

"That's not what you did."

"Exactly. Learn from my failure." Chen met her eyes. "I proved FTL was possible. You prove it's sustainable. That's a more important achievement."

Kioko absorbed that. "Modified protocols starting next jump."

The pilot corps expanded. Six qualified navigators. Twelve in training. Enough redundancy to prevent single-point-of-failure.

Chen watched them develop. Each pilot finding their own style. Some favored precision. Some optimized for speed. Some balanced biological cost against performance metrics.

No one matched her zero-drift achievements. But several exceeded her sustainability.

"You built something remarkable," Yamamoto told her one evening. "A viable FTL program with operational safety protocols."

"I destroyed my body doing it."

"You took necessary risks to prove the concept. That was your role. Now others refine the implementation." Yamamoto pulled up program statistics. "Average pilot cellular aging per jump: twenty-two hours. Navigation drift: point-two light-years. Both acceptable for operational deployment."

"Fleet Command approved it?"

"Formal authorization came through today. FTL-capable ships entering production. Full pilot corps recruitment starting next month." Yamamoto smiled. "You did it, Chen. You made faster-than-light travel real."

Chen looked at the program metrics. Pilots jumping across vast distances. Humanity expanding beyond Sol system limitations. The future opening up in ways previous generations could only imagine.

And she'd paid for it in biological years. Forty weeks of accelerated aging. Cellular damage that would shorten her lifespan by unknown amounts.

Worth it?

She thought about the first jump. The terror and exhilaration. The sensation of breaking light-speed and surviving.

Yes. Worth it.

"What's next for you?" Yamamoto asked.

"Long-term studies. Biological impacts of repeated FTL exposure. Methods to reduce cellular stress. Maybe therapies to reverse some of the damage." Chen pulled up research proposals. "I broke myself proving this worked. Now I figure out how to keep it from breaking others."

"Medical research instead of piloting?"

"Applied biology in service of FTL operations. Still contributing. Just differently."

Yamamoto nodded. "Sounds like a good second act."

Chen watched the latest pilot complete their jump. Smooth transition. Acceptable drift. Sustainable biological cost.

The future of space travel. Made possible by pioneers willing to pay the price.

She'd been a pioneer.

Now she'd help others avoid paying as much as she had.

Different role. Same mission.

Pushing humanity forward.

One jump at a time.
