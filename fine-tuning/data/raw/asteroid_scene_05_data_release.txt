Chen "Wrench" Liu floated in Neptune's Pride's cargo bay, staring at the unknown element samples with new understanding.

Three weeks of study. Three weeks of careful analysis. And he'd finally figured out what made it special.

It wasn't just responsive to electromagnetic fields. It generated them. Created standing waves in local spacetime. Bent physics in ways that shouldn't be possible.

"Captain, you need to see this," he called over the comm.

Jax arrived within minutes. "What did you find?"

"This element doesn't just react to EM fields. It creates localized spacetime distortions. Tiny ones. Measurable ones."

"In human terms, Chen."

"It's a naturally occurring exotic matter. The stuff theoretical physicists dream about. The stuff you need for stable wormholes. For Alcubierre drives. For everything FTL-related that's currently impossible."

Jax stared at the samples. "You're saying this is the key to faster-than-light travel?"

"Maybe. If we can synthesize it. Understand it. Harness it. This is potentially the most valuable substance in human space."

"Which is why Olympus wants it."

"Which is why everyone will want it once word gets out."

Jax pulled up their position. Three light-days from anywhere. Drifting. Vulnerable.

"We can't sell it. Can't hide it. Can't use it. Every option makes us targets."

"What if we give it away?" Sofia suggested, joining them in the cargo bay. "Publish the data. Make it public knowledge. Remove the exclusivity."

"You want to hand revolutionary technology to everyone?"

"I want to remove the target from our backs. If everyone has access to the data, nobody has reason to hunt us."

"They'd still want samples. Physical specimens for research."

"Then we keep one gram. Destroy the rest. Give humanity the knowledge. Keep only enough to prove it exists."

Jax considered. It was crazy. Throwing away fortune. But maybe that was the only way to survive.

"Chen, how much do we have total?"

"Seventeen kilograms. In various sample sizes."

"Package one hundred grams for secure storage. Destroy the rest."

"Jax, we could be billionaires!"

"Or we could be dead. I'd rather be poor and breathing." She pulled up communication protocols. "Sofia, start drafting the data release. I want full analysis. Chemical composition. EM properties. Spacetime distortion measurements. Everything."

"Olympus will be furious."

"Olympus can join the line. Chen, start disposal procedures. Vent the samples into space. Scatter them across a light-year. Make recovery impossible."

Chen hesitated. Then nodded. "It's the right call. Probably."

They worked through the night. Sofia compiling data. Chen preparing samples for disposal. Kayla plotting distribution patterns.

By dawn, they were ready.

Seventeen kilograms of the most valuable substance in human space, prepared for destruction.

"Last chance to change your mind," Sofia said.

Jax looked at the samples. At her crew. At the choice between wealth and survival.

"Do it."

Chen triggered the disposal sequence. Cargo bay depressurized. Samples ejected in a dispersal pattern designed by Kayla.

Seventeen kilograms scattered across space. Individual grams drifting in different directions. Recoverable only with months of search effort.

Gone.

Sofia transmitted the data package. Full scientific analysis. Published to every major research institution. Open source. Free.

"Message sent," she reported. "The data is public."

Jax felt relief and regret in equal measure. "We just gave away a fortune."

"We gave away knowledge. Knowledge can't be stolen from us now. It belongs to everyone."

"Very philosophical. Also very broke."

"But alive. Can't spend money if you're dead."

Jax pulled up navigation charts. With the element gone, they were just another independent ship. No special cargo. No corporate interest.

"Where to, Captain?" Kayla asked.

"Somewhere quiet. Somewhere we can disappear. Somewhere Olympus won't bother looking."

"The outer belt. Kuiper objects. Scattered disk."

"Perfect. Plot a course. Let's go be poor and boring."

The Neptune's Pride accelerated on minimal thrust. Away from civilization. Away from corporations. Away from anything that mattered to the powers that controlled human space.

Chen joined Jax on the bridge. "We did the right thing."

"Did we? Or did we just give away humanity's future because we were scared?"

"Both, probably. But scared keeps you alive long enough to see the future you're giving away."

Jax smiled despite herself. "When did you become philosophical?"

"When I started contemplating exotic matter at 3 AM. Does things to your perspective."

They watched space scroll past. Empty. Dark. Infinite.

Somewhere behind them, the scattered samples drifted. Waiting for whoever came looking. Humanity's key to faster-than-light travel, free for the taking.

If anyone could find it. If anyone could gather it. If anyone could figure out what to do with it.

"Someone will retrieve those samples," Sofia said. "Probably Olympus. Probably soon."

"Let them. The data's public. They can't monopolize knowledge that's freely available."

"They can monopolize applications. Patents. Commercial development."

"That's tomorrow's problem. Today, we're alive. That's victory enough."

The ship jumped to sublight cruise. Heading for the outer dark. Where corporate interests didn't reach. Where independent crews could survive without constant threat.

It would be cold. Lonely. Probably dangerous in ways they hadn't imagined.

But it would be free. Truly free. For the first time since finding the unknown element.

Jax pulled up the crew roster. Four names. Four lives. Four people who'd chosen poverty over pursuit.

Not heroes. Just survivors. Making the smart call instead of the profitable one.

And somehow, that felt right.

The Neptune's Pride disappeared into the dark. One more ship among millions. Unremarkable. Forgotten.

Exactly as planned.
