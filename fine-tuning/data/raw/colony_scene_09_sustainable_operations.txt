The regolith processor screamed in protest. Alexis killed the power before the bearing could seize completely.

"That's the third failure this month," she said, pulling up the maintenance logs.

The processor was supposed to run continuously—grinding Martian regolith into feedstock for the 3D printers and extracting rare earth elements for Earth Corp's profit margins. Instead, it failed with predictable regularity, each breakdown eating into production quotas and crew morale.

Chen, the maintenance chief, emerged from under the machine covered in rust-red dust.

"Bearings are shot. Again." He held up the destroyed component. "Martian dust is finer than the specs accounted for. Gets past every filter we have."

"Can you fabricate replacements?"

"Sure. Out of what?" Chen gestured at their limited material stock. "We're already cannibalizing parts from non-essential systems. Pretty soon we'll be choosing between processing regolith and maintaining life support."

Alexis ran the numbers. They had enough spare parts for maybe three more bearing failures. After that, improvisation became desperation.

"I'll talk to Rivera about requisitioning better filtration in the next supply run."

"That's four months out."

"I know."

Chen wiped his hands on a rag. "We can't keep this pace, Alexis. Earth Corp wants production. Mars wants to kill our equipment. Something's got to give."

Alexis helped him disassemble the bearing housing. The metal was scored and pitted from abrasive dust. The seals that were supposed to protect it had failed—polymer degraded by Mars's harsh environment faster than Earth testing predicted.

"What if we slowed production?" she said. "Ran the processor at seventy percent capacity. Less stress on components, longer operational life."

"Earth Corp would lose their minds."

"They're going to lose more if the processor dies completely." Alexis pulled up the failure projection. "At current pace, we've got maybe six weeks before catastrophic breakdown. If we reduce load now, we could extend that to six months. Give us time to get better parts."

Chen studied the projection. "You really think Rivera will approve reducing output?"

"I think she'll approve surviving until the next supply run."

The meeting with Rivera went about as expected. The commander listened, understood the math, and hated the implications.

"Earth Corp is already unhappy with our metrics. Reducing production will confirm their worst assumptions about colony viability."

"Destroying the processor will end production entirely." Alexis showed her the breakdown timeline. "This isn't about quotas anymore. It's about keeping essential equipment functional."

Rivera pulled up the latest correspondence from Earth Corp. Alexis could see the subject lines: "Underperformance Review," "Resource Allocation Concerns," "Viability Assessment."

"They're looking for excuses to shut us down," Rivera said quietly.

"Then we don't give them one. We manage our resources intelligently and prove we can sustain long-term operations." Alexis highlighted the extended timeline. "Six months gets us to the next supply run with margin to spare. We demonstrate patience and planning instead of desperation."

Rivera was quiet, weighing political costs against practical reality.

"Do it. But I want detailed reporting. Every hour of reduced operation, every component we save, every efficiency we gain. We're going to prove this was smart management, not failure."

Alexis implemented the changes that afternoon. The regolith processor dropped to seventy percent capacity. Production metrics immediately fell, but equipment stress indicators improved. The bearings ran cooler, the filters lasted longer, the maintenance intervals extended.

Earth Corp's response arrived three days later. Marcus Webb's face filled the comm screen, his expression carefully neutral.

"Commander Rivera, I'm reviewing your latest production reports. Care to explain the fourteen percent reduction in output?"

"Preventative maintenance, Mr. Webb. We're extending equipment life to ensure long-term viability."

"By missing quotas."

"By avoiding catastrophic failures that would miss quotas permanently." Rivera pulled up Alexis's analysis. "Our projections show this approach maintains stable production through the next supply cycle. The alternative is complete processor failure in approximately six weeks."

Webb studied the data. "And if you're wrong? If this is just inefficiency disguised as caution?"

"Then I take full responsibility. But I'm not wrong."

The transmission ended with Webb's displeasure evident but not actionable. Rivera slumped in her chair.

"He's going to use this against us."

"Let him try," Alexis said. "We have the engineering data to back up our decision."

The reduced production pace had unexpected benefits. With less time running the processor, the maintenance crew could focus on preventative care. Filters were changed before they failed. Bearings were lubricated on schedule. The whole facility ran smoother.

And the crew had more time for other work. Research. Exploration. Communication with Ares.

Omar spent his extra hours expanding the electromagnetic analysis of Ares's signals. Patterns emerged—diurnal cycles, response variations, what might be emotional states or cognitive processes.

"Ares is more active during colony work hours," Omar reported. "And less active when we're sleeping. It's synchronizing with our schedule."

"Empathy or adaptation?" Alexis asked.

"Maybe both. Maybe for Ares, there's no difference."

Yuki used the time to optimize hydroponics. New growth techniques, better nutrient formulas, higher yields from the same space. The fresh vegetables improved crew morale measurably.

Alexis found herself with something she hadn't had in months—time to think. She spent evenings in the observation dome, watching Mars's sunset turn the sky from butterscotch to navy to star-scattered black.

The planet was beautiful in its hostility. Every crater a reminder of ancient violence. Every canyon a scar from epochs of geological warfare. Mars didn't nurture life. It challenged life to prove its worth.

And somehow, Ares had survived here. Thrived here, in its own patient way.

"Mind if I join you?"

Rivera settled into the adjacent seat. Together they watched Phobos rise—a lumpy moon racing across the Martian sky.

"You ever regret coming here?" Rivera asked.

"Every time something breaks. Which is daily." Alexis smiled. "But no. Not really. Mars is exactly what it promised to be. Difficult. Dangerous. Worth it."

"Earth Corp doesn't see worth. They see profit and loss statements."

"Then they're missing the point." Alexis gestured at the Martian landscape. "We're not here to extract value. We're here to prove humanity can exist beyond Earth. That we can adapt, survive, cooperate with alien intelligence. That's worth more than rare earth elements."

Rivera was quiet for a moment. "That's a nice philosophy. Not sure it pays the bills."

"It might. Long term." Alexis pulled up her tablet, showing colony sustainability models. "If we focus on self-sufficiency instead of extraction—if we learn from Mars instead of just taking from it—we build something permanent. Something that doesn't need Earth Corp's approval to exist."

"You're talking about independence."

"I'm talking about survival. Real survival, not just quarterly metrics." Alexis highlighted the thermal exchange with Ares. "We have a renewable heat source. We're developing efficient hydroponics. We're learning to manufacture replacement parts with local materials. Every piece of that reduces our dependence on Earth. Makes us more viable, not less."

Rivera studied the models. "This would take years to implement fully."

"Good thing we're committed to being here permanently."

The commander smiled. "You know, when Earth Corp assigned me to Mars, I thought it was a punishment posting. Manage the frontier colony, keep the engineers from revolting, hit production targets."

"And now?"

"Now I think maybe it's the most important command in human history." Rivera looked at Phobos racing across the sky. "We're not just colonizing Mars. We're learning how to be better than Earth's mistakes. How to coexist instead of conquer. How to build instead of extract."

"That's assuming Earth Corp lets us."

"Then we make ourselves too valuable to shut down." Rivera stood. "Keep working on those sustainability models. I want something comprehensive to show Webb when he inevitably questions our approach again."

Alexis spent the next week refining the independence proposal. Every system mapped for self-sufficiency potential. Every dependency on Earth identified for reduction or elimination. By the end, she had a roadmap for Mars colony viability that barely required Earth Corp at all.

Rivera reviewed it with visible satisfaction. "This is going to make them very nervous."

"Good. Nervous means they're paying attention."

"Or nervous means they shut us down before we become a threat to their control."

"Then we prove we're an opportunity, not a threat." Alexis pulled up the final projection. "Mars as an independent science station, partnered with Earth but not controlled by it. Focused on xenobiology, planetary science, sustainable colonization research. We become valuable for knowledge instead of extraction."

"And Ares?"

"Becomes our partner. Proof that humanity can coexist with alien intelligence." Alexis showed the communication logs. "We're documenting unprecedented xenobiological cooperation. That's worth more than any mineral deposit."

Rivera forwarded the proposal to Earth Corp with a cover memo framing it as "Long-term Strategic Viability Assessment." Bureaucratic language for "we're charting our own course."

Webb's response took a week. When it came, it was surprisingly measured.

"Your proposal has merit. Earth Corp's board is intrigued by the xenobiological research potential. We're authorizing expanded scientific operations and reduced extraction quotas."

Rivera read the message twice. "They're actually approving this?"

"They're seeing the PR value," Alexis said. "First contact with alien intelligence. Peaceful cooperation with Martian natives. That's a better story than strip mining Mars for rare earths."

"I'll take it. Whatever the reason."

The colony shifted focus over the following months. The regolith processor ran at sustainable capacity. Research expanded. Communication protocols with Ares grew more sophisticated. They developed a symbolic language based on thermal patterns, electromagnetic pulses, even seismic vibrations.

Ares participated patiently. Answered questions when possible. Declined to answer when the concepts didn't translate. Shared heat when the colony needed it. Withdrew when it needed rest.

A genuine partnership developed. Not perfect. Not always clear. But real.

Alexis stood in the subsurface tunnel one evening, reviewing the day's communication logs. Ares had described—as best they could translate—its perception of time. Not linear like humans experienced it, but cyclical. Seasons measured in centuries. Consciousness that flowed with geological patience.

"We're so fast compared to you," Alexis said. "Do we seem frantic? Rushed?"

Ares's response came in careful thermal pulses: Different speeds. Same existence. Both valid.

Alexis smiled. "Yeah. I suppose they are."

She headed back to her quarters. Outside the viewports, Mars turned under its sparse stars. The colony lights glowed warm against the rust-red surface. Seventy-two humans and one ancient Martian intelligence, sharing a planet and figuring out what that meant.

Earth Corp wanted metrics and quotas. But Alexis knew what they were really building.

The future. One careful cooperation at a time.
