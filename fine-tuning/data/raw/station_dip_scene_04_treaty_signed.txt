The peace treaty signed at 0347, three hours before the bombs were scheduled to detonate.

Ambassador Chen Wu watched the delegates add their signatures. Coalition. Frontier. Station neutral parties. Everyone committing to verifiable disarmament. Third-party enforcement. Real peace instead of preparation for mutual genocide.

It was the most beautiful document he'd ever seen. And the most terrifying.

Because Dr. Okonkwo still had to disarm the bombs.

"It's done," Director Nkrumah said quietly. "Both sides agreed. Weapons inspections start in seventy-two hours. Military forces withdraw to pre-conflict positions. The bioweapons programs terminate immediately."

"Will they actually comply?"

"Unknown. But they signed. Under witness. With legal force behind the commitments. That's more than we had six hours ago." Nkrumah activated his comm. "Dr. Okonkwo, the treaty is signed. Are you satisfied?"

Silence. Long enough that Chen's heart started racing.

Then Okonkwo's voice came through. "I need to verify the terms. Ensure they're genuine. That this isn't theater to buy time while the bombs count down."

"You have three hours," Nkrumah said. "Use them. But Doctor—if you detonate those bombs after we achieved what you demanded, you're not a revolutionary. You're just a murderer."

The comm closed. Chen looked at the delegates. They were exhausted. Terrified. They'd negotiated under threat of imminent death. Every concession made with explosives counting down in the walls.

"Will it hold?" Coalition Ambassador Zhang asked. "The treaty. Or did we just sign worthless paper to save our skins?"

"That depends on whether you honor it," Chen said. "Whether both sides choose to live by the agreement or treat it as tactical delay."

"And if one side violates?"

"Then the other responds. And we're back to genocide preparation. Except this time with the knowledge that peace was possible and we chose war anyway." Chen pulled up the treaty terms. "Gentlemen, this document is the universe giving us a second chance. What we do with it determines whether future generations curse our names or build monuments to our wisdom."

The delegates dispersed. Chen remained in the council chamber, staring at the signed treaty.

Lena Volkov entered. The security chief looked like she hadn't slept in days.

"We found the bomb locations. Twelve devices total. All rigged with anti-tamper protocols. Okonkwo's work is sophisticated. Professional. Military-grade execution."

"Can you disarm them?"

"If she provides the deactivation codes. Without those, touching them risks detonation. We'd kill everyone trying to save them." Volkov pulled up schematics. "She built in redundancy. Fail-safes. Dead man switches. This wasn't amateur terrorism. This was calculated precision by someone who knew exactly what they were doing."

"She's a doctor. Medical staff. Where did she learn to build bombs?"

"Coalition military service. Before she went into medicine. Demolitions specialist during the frontier conflicts." Volkov highlighted Okonkwo's service record. "She's seen what war does. Firsthand. The casualties. The atrocities. That's why she went into medicine—to save instead of destroy. But she remembers how to do both."

Chen felt the pieces clicking together. A doctor who'd been a soldier. Who'd killed in the past and now tried to heal. Who'd seen genocide preparation and decided desperate action was better than complicity.

"Where is she now?"

"Unknown. She went dark after Nkrumah's call. Could be anywhere on the station. Or already evacuated. We're searching but she's good at hiding."

Chen pulled up the station map. Eight thousand people spread across thirty kilometers. Finding one person who didn't want to be found would take time they didn't have.

"Broadcast a message. Station-wide. Tell her the treaty is real. Show her the terms. Let her verify our sincerity."

"And if she doesn't believe us?"

"Then we die in three hours and the treaty dies with us. And the genocide proceeds exactly as she predicted." Chen started drafting the message. "But maybe—maybe she actually wants peace. Maybe the bombs were always a bluff. A way to force genuine negotiations without ever intending to detonate."

"That's optimistic."

"I'm a diplomat. Optimism is my job description." Chen finalized the message. "Broadcast it. Everywhere. Make sure she hears."

The message went out. Chen's face appeared on every screen throughout the station.

"Dr. Okonkwo, this is Ambassador Chen Wu. The peace treaty is signed. Both sides have committed to verifiable disarmament. Third-party enforcement begins in seventy-two hours. Bioweapons programs terminate immediately. Military forces withdraw. The genocide you feared is prevented. Please verify the treaty terms. Confirm our sincerity. And disarm the bombs. Let us prove that peace is possible. That your desperate action achieved its goal. That sometimes threats work when diplomacy fails."

He paused. Looked directly at the camera.

"You were right. The talks were theater. Both sides were preparing genocide. But you changed that. Forced us to confront what we were enabling. Made us choose between peace and annihilation. We chose peace. Now please—let us live long enough to prove that choice was genuine."

The message ended. Chen waited. The council chamber felt smaller somehow. Like the walls were closing in as the countdown continued.

Twenty-seven minutes passed. Chen checked his chrono obsessively. Watched the seconds tick toward detonation.

Then his comm chimed. Private channel. Audio only.

"Ambassador Chen. This is Dr. Okonkwo."

"Doctor. Did you review the treaty?"

"I did. It's comprehensive. Verifiable. Enforced. Everything I demanded." Her voice was steady. "I'm impressed. I didn't think the delegates were capable of genuine negotiation."

"They're capable when properly motivated."

"By threat of imminent death. That's not diplomacy, Ambassador. That's hostage negotiation."

"Sometimes there's no difference. The question is whether the outcome serves peace or perpetuates violence." Chen checked the chrono. Ninety minutes until detonation. "Doctor, will you disarm the bombs?"

Silence. Chen counted heartbeats. Thirty-seven of them.

"Yes. I will disarm the bombs. On one condition."

"Name it."

"The station broadcasts the treaty. Publicly. With signatures visible. Full transparency. Both sides announcing their commitment to peace. No quiet burial in classified archives. Public accountability for the promises made."

"Agreed. We were planning that anyway. The treaty only works if people know it exists. If they can verify compliance."

"Then send security to the following locations." Okonkwo transmitted coordinates. "I'll meet them at each device. Provide deactivation codes. Supervise disarmament personally. I owe it to the people I threatened to ensure they're safe."

Chen relayed the information to Volkov. The security chief dispatched teams immediately.

"Doctor, one question. If the treaty had failed—if the delegates refused to negotiate genuinely—would you have detonated?"

The line was quiet for a long time.

"I don't know, Ambassador. I built the bombs believing I could pull the trigger if necessary. But standing here, looking at the timer, I'm not certain I actually could have. Maybe I'm not the revolutionary I thought. Maybe I'm just a desperate woman who gambled everything on a bluff."

"Does it matter? The bluff worked. The treaty exists. Peace is possible."

"For now. Until the next crisis. The next genocidal impulse. The next time humanity decides annihilation is preferable to coexistence." Okonkwo sighed. "I bought us time, Ambassador. Maybe a generation. Maybe a century. But the fundamental problem remains—we're a species that solves conflicts through violence. Eventually, that will destroy us."

"Maybe. Or maybe we learn. Maybe each crisis teaches us. Makes us slightly better. Slightly wiser." Chen looked at the treaty. "You risked everything to prove peace was possible. That counts for something. That might be the lesson that saves us next time."

"I hope you're right. For all our sakes."

The line closed. Chen watched the security feeds as Okonkwo appeared at each bomb location. Provided codes. Supervised disarmament with the precision of someone who'd built the devices and now chose to unmake them.

The last bomb disarmed at 0639. Twenty-three minutes before scheduled detonation.

Chen Wu, career diplomat, sat in the empty council chamber and allowed himself to breathe.

Eight thousand people would live. The treaty would stand. Peace would have its chance.

All because a desperate woman had threatened annihilation to prevent it.

The universe had a sense of irony. Dark. Twisted. But occasionally effective.

He pulled up the treaty one more time. Studied the signatures. The commitments. The fragile hope captured in legal language.

It would work. Or it wouldn't. Humanity would learn. Or it wouldn't.

But for now, today, peace had won.

And that was enough.
