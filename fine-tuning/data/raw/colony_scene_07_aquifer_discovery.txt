The drill brought up water at forty meters.

Hassan stared at the sample. Liquid water. On Mars. Not ice that required melting. Not trace moisture in regolith. Liquid water pooled in subsurface cavities.

"Test it," Alexis said immediately. "Contamination, mineral content, everything."

The analysis took three hours. Hassan reviewed the results twice before trusting them.

"It's clean. Well, Martian-clean. High mineral content, some perchlorates, but filterable. And there's a lot of it."

"How much is a lot?"

Hassan pulled up the ground-penetrating radar. "The aquifer extends approximately three kilometers in every direction. Conservative estimate? Fifty million liters."

Alexis felt something between hope and terror. Fifty million liters would supply the colony for decades. Eliminate their dependence on water recycling. Provide margin for expansion.

Or it would become a resource fight that destroyed them.

"Who knows about this?" she asked.

"Just us. And the drill team. Six people."

"Keep it that way. Until we understand what we're dealing with."

They ran additional surveys. The aquifer was vast—a subsurface reservoir protected from sublimation by overlying rock. Fed by some process no one fully understood. Maybe ancient ice deposits. Maybe active geology.

The origin didn't matter. The existence did.

Rivera was briefed that evening. His reaction was immediate.

"We report this to Earth Corp immediately. This is a major discovery. Changes the entire colonization calculus."

"It also makes us a target," Alexis countered. "Water is the most valuable resource on Mars. Every corporation in the solar system will want control of this aquifer."

"We already filed claim on this territory. It's ours."

"Earth Corp owns the claim. We're just lessees. The moment they realize the value, they'll bring in their own people. Cut us out entirely."

Rivera studied the aquifer maps. "You're suggesting we hide a major resource discovery from our corporate backers?"

"I'm suggesting we think carefully before handing them leverage." Alexis pulled up the colony's contract. "We're required to report significant discoveries. But we define significant. A small aquifer that supplements colony operations isn't worth reporting. A massive reservoir that enables planetary development is."

"You want to minimize the discovery?"

"I want to protect our position. We report a modest water source. Enough to improve operations but not enough to trigger corporate intervention."

"That's fraud."

"That's survival." Alexis met his eyes. "Earth Corp will use this discovery to justify replacing us with corporate personnel. Everything we've built gets handed to people who had nothing to do with the survival challenges."

Rivera was silent for a long moment. "How do we minimize an aquifer this size?"

"We report only what we're actively using. Drill a modest extraction well. File it as supplementary water source. Keep the full extent classified as ongoing geological research."

"That won't work indefinitely. Eventually someone will do comprehensive surveys."

"Then we have time to establish indispensable value. Make ourselves so critical to operations that Earth Corp can't justify replacement."

Rivera made the decision. "We report a minor aquifer find. Supplementary resource. No mention of scale."

The extraction well was drilled a week later. Modest capacity—enough to reduce colony water stress but not eliminate it. The full aquifer remained concealed beneath bureaucratic language and selective reporting.

Earth Corp's response was encouraging. Standard acknowledgment of resource discovery. No immediate action.

The colony began using the aquifer water. Filtration systems removed perchlorates and minerals. The quality wasn't perfect but it was usable.

More importantly, it bought them breathing room.

Yuki expanded the hydroponics using supplementary water. Crop yields increased. The colony's food self-sufficiency improved.

Hassan continued geological surveys, carefully documenting the aquifer while keeping reports vague about full extent.

Three months later, a corporate geology team arrived for routine inspection.

Alexis watched them work with barely concealed tension. If they ran comprehensive surveys, the aquifer's true size would be obvious.

Dr. Miranda Chen led the inspection team. The same liaison who'd conducted the efficiency review. She noticed the water consumption patterns immediately.

"Your usage increased significantly," she noted. "But recycling system outputs haven't changed. Where's the additional water coming from?"

"Subsurface source," Alexis said. "We filed the discovery report three months ago."

Miranda pulled up the report. "This describes a minor aquifer. Supplementary capacity only."

"That's accurate."

"Your consumption patterns suggest more than supplementary capacity. You're using fifteen percent more water than before the discovery."

Alexis kept her expression neutral. "Optimized extraction efficiency. We're getting more from the source than initial surveys indicated."

Miranda's eyes narrowed. "I want to run independent surveys."

"That's your right. We'll provide full access to the drill sites and our geological data."

Miranda's team spent four days surveying. They drilled additional core samples. Ran ground-penetrating radar. Analyzed mineral composition.

Hassan watched them work, his stress visible. They were being thorough. Professional. Exactly the kind of investigation that would reveal the truth.

On day five, Miranda requested a meeting with Rivera and Alexis.

"Your minor aquifer is actually a major hydrological formation," she said without preamble. "Estimated reserves exceed fifty million liters. That's not supplementary. That's transformative."

"The full extent wasn't clear from initial surveys," Rivera said.

"Bullshit. Your chief geologist is Dr. Hassan. He's one of the best planetary geologists working. He would've known."

Alexis made the decision to be direct. "We knew. We chose to report conservatively."

"You chose to hide a major resource discovery. That violates your contract."

"Our contract requires reporting significant discoveries. We reported what we discovered. The significance was uncertain."

"The significance is obvious." Miranda pulled up corporate resource projections. "This aquifer enables colony expansion by an order of magnitude. Earth Corp needs to know this for proper planning."

"Earth Corp will use this to justify corporate takeover," Alexis said. "Replace us with their own people. That's the real issue."

Miranda studied her. "You think you can hide from your own employers?"

"We think we can establish indispensable value before they realize what we have."

"Too late. I'm filing a comprehensive report today. Earth Corp will know the aquifer's full extent by next week."

Alexis felt the situation slipping away. "What if we negotiate? Demonstrate that the current crew can manage expanded operations?"

"You already demonstrated you'll hide critical information. That's not a foundation for trust."

Rivera intervened. "Dr. Chen, we're not trying to defraud Earth Corp. We're trying to protect the people who survived two years of Martian hell to build this colony. We deserve consideration in how this resource is developed."

Miranda's expression softened slightly. "I understand your position. But my job is corporate interests, not crew sentiment."

"Can those interests align? We want to stay. Earth Corp wants profitable operations. We can deliver that."

"Maybe. But that's above my authority." Miranda closed her tablet. "I'll include your concerns in my report. But the full aquifer data goes to the board. They decide next steps."

She filed the report that evening. Comprehensive geological analysis. Full aquifer extent. Resource development potential.

And a note recommending retention of current crew based on demonstrated operational competence.

Not the outcome Alexis wanted. But better than she'd feared.

The board's response came three weeks later. Approval for colony expansion. Budget increase for additional personnel. And—critically—retention of current crew as core operational team.

Earth Corp wanted the aquifer developed. But they recognized that the people who'd found it knew how to survive on Mars.

"We did it," Rivera said, reading the response. "Not the way we planned, but we did it."

"We bought ourselves position," Alexis corrected. "Now we deliver results or they replace us anyway."

Hassan joined them in the command center. "Expansion means more people. More infrastructure. More complexity."

"More opportunity," Yuki added. "To build something sustainable."

Alexis looked at the aquifer data. Fifty million liters. Enough to support a real city.

The colony was growing.

Whether that growth was success or compromise, she couldn't say.

But they were still here.

Still building.

That had to be enough.
