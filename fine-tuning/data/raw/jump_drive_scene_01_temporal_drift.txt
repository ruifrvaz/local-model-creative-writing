Dr. Kenji Yamamoto stared at the navigation error that killed three seconds of Lieutenant Sarah Chen's life.

Three seconds. She'd jumped to Proxima Centauri and back. Round trip, four light-years. Subjective time: ninety minutes.

Objective time: ninety minutes and three seconds.

The numbers didn't add up. Jump drives were supposed to be time-symmetric. You left, you arrived. No temporal drift.

Except Sarah had lost three seconds somewhere in the quantum foam between here and there.

And she didn't remember losing them.

Kenji pulled up her medical scans. Brain activity normal. Neural patterns unchanged. Blood work clean. By every measurable metric, Sarah was fine.

But three seconds of her life were gone. Unaccounted for.

He found her in the observation lounge, staring at stars with the intensity of someone searching for answers.

"How are you feeling?" he asked.

"Like I've forgotten something important." Sarah didn't look at him. "The jump felt normal. Standard Alcubierre transition. But when I came out..."

"What?"

"I had this sense of... incompleteness. Like I'd started a thought and lost the ending."

Kenji sat beside her. "The temporal drift bothers you."

"Three seconds is nothing. People lose more time yawning. But I should remember those seconds. I was conscious. Alert. Monitoring systems." Sarah finally met his eyes. "Where did they go?"

That was the question. Kenji had run the math fifty times. Jump drives bent spacetime. Created bubbles of warped geometry that allowed faster-than-light travel without violating relativity.

But they shouldn't steal time.

"I want to run another test," he said carefully.

"You want me to jump again."

"With full instrumentation. Neural monitors. Quantum clocks synchronized to femtosecond precision. We'll track every moment from departure to return."

Sarah was quiet. Then: "How dangerous?"

"Unknown. The temporal drift might be nothing. Or it might be cumulative." Kenji pulled up his theoretical models. "Admiral Kowalski wants faster jump sequences. More testing. Eventually, commercial deployment. But if time drift accumulates—"

"Every jump steals a little more. Eventually, the pilot's timeline and realtime desynchronize completely."

"Exactly."

Sarah stood and walked to the viewport. Outside, the test range stretched empty. Marker buoys floating in the dark. The nearest, Proxima Centauri, a faint red spark.

"When do you want to run the test?"

"You don't have to volunteer."

"I'm the best jump pilot in the program. And you need data." Sarah turned back. "But Kenji, if this goes wrong—if the drift is worse than three seconds—you shut down the program. Clear?"

"I can't promise that. Kowalski has final authority."

"Then make him promise. Because I'm not losing years of my life to military ambition."

Kenji knew she was right. Kowalski wanted results. Wanted faster ships. Wanted humanity expanding to the stars on technology that might be fundamentally dangerous.

"I'll talk to him," Kenji said.

The admiral's office was spartan. No decorations. No personal touches. Just efficiency and duty.

"Dr. Yamamoto. What can I do for you?"

"I need authorization to suspend testing if temporal drift exceeds acceptable limits."

Kowalski's expression didn't change. "Define acceptable."

"Anything beyond five seconds per jump."

"That's arbitrary."

"It's conservative. We don't understand the mechanism. Until we do, we should minimize exposure."

Kowalski pulled up the program timeline. "We're behind schedule. Corporate partners are demanding demonstration jumps. Political pressure is mounting for military applications."

"With respect, Admiral, politics doesn't change physics."

"No. But it changes funding. And without funding, your research stops." Kowalski leaned forward. "I understand your concerns. I share them. But we need results."

"Not at the cost of our pilots' lives."

"Lieutenant Chen volunteered. She understands the risks."

"She understands the known risks. The temporal drift is unknown. Potentially catastrophic." Kenji pulled up his models. "Look at this. If drift is exponential, tenth jump could cost hours. Twentieth could cost days."

"Or it could plateau. Or reverse. You don't know."

"Exactly. We don't know. That's why we should proceed carefully."

Kowalski studied the data. Kenji could see the calculation behind his eyes. Risk versus reward. Progress versus safety.

"You have authorization for one more test," Kowalski said finally. "Full instrumentation. If drift exceeds five seconds, we pause for analysis. If it's stable or decreasing, we accelerate testing."

"And if it's increasing?"

"Then we reassess." Kowalski's tone was final. "But Dr. Yamamoto, understand this: jump drive technology is humanity's future. We will make it work. The only question is whether we do it safely or desperately."

Kenji left the office feeling hollow. One test. One pilot's timeline. One chance to prove the technology was safe or stop it before someone paid the ultimate price.

He found Sarah in the pilot ready room. "Test approved. Tomorrow, 0800 hours."

"Drift threshold?"

"Five seconds."

Sarah nodded. "I'll be ready. But Kenji, if something goes wrong—if I don't come back the same—you tell my family what happened. Not the sanitized version. The truth."

"I will."

She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "The things we do for science."

Kenji returned to his lab. The jump drive equations filled his screens. Beautiful mathematics describing impossible geometry. Spacetime bent like paper. Causality preserved through careful boundary conditions.

All elegant. All theoretical. All potentially lethal.

He pulled up Sarah's neural scans again. Looking for something. Anything that would explain the missing three seconds.

The data showed nothing.

Which meant the answer was hidden somewhere humans couldn't easily measure. In subjective experience. In consciousness itself.

Kenji added monitoring protocols to the test plan. Brain imaging. Neural network analysis. Real-time consciousness assessment.

If Sarah lost time tomorrow, he'd know where it went.

Or at least, he'd have data proving they didn't understand the question.

Outside his window, Proxima Centauri burned. Four light-years away. Minutes by jump drive. A lifetime by conventional propulsion.

Humanity's future waited there. And beyond. Thousands of stars. Billions of planets.

All reachable. If the price wasn't too high.

Kenji worked through the night, preparing instruments, refining protocols. Building safeguards against dangers he couldn't predict.

By dawn, everything was ready.

The test would proceed. Sarah would jump.

And they'd learn whether faster-than-light travel stole more than just distance.

Whether it stole time itself.
