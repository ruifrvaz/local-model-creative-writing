Lieutenant Sarah Chen ran pre-flight on the test ship Alcubierre's Dream.

The vessel was small. Barely twenty meters long. Just a cockpit, jump drive, and enough life support for six-hour missions. Built for one purpose: testing faster-than-light travel.

She'd flown it seventeen times. Each jump smooth. Each return successful.

Except for three missing seconds that haunted her.

"Neural monitors online," Dr. Aisha Mbara reported from medical bay. "I'm reading your brainwaves clearly. The quantum clocks are synchronized."

"Copy that." Sarah strapped in. The cockpit was familiar. Comfortable. Like a second skin.

But today felt different. Today, she was hunting ghosts in the quantum foam.

Kenji's voice came through the comm. "Sarah, final check. You're comfortable proceeding?"

"As comfortable as anyone jumping four light-years on experimental technology."

"That's not a yes."

She smiled despite the tension. "It's a yes, Kenji. Let's find your missing time."

The jump drive spooled up. Sarah felt it in her bones—a vibration that wasn't quite physical. The Alcubierre metric warping spacetime around the ship.

She pulled up the navigation plot. Proxima Centauri. Four point two light-years. The jump would take subjective minutes.

How much objective time she'd lose was the question.

"Drive charged," she reported. "Initiating jump in three. Two. One."

Reality folded.

Sarah had jumped seventeen times, but she'd never gotten used to the sensation. Space wasn't meant to bend this way. Her visual cortex struggled to process the warped geometry. Her inner ear rebelled against acceleration that wasn't acceleration.

The cockpit displays showed impossible things. Stars stretched into lines. Light bent around the ship's Alcubierre bubble. Causality itself became negotiable.

Then Proxima Centauri filled her viewport. Red. Angry. Close.

She'd traveled four light-years in ninety seconds.

Sarah checked the clocks. Ship time matched her perception. But back at the test facility—

"Alcubierre's Dream, this is Control. Reading your arrival. Time displacement: four seconds."

Four seconds. One more than last jump.

Sarah felt her stomach drop. "Copy that. Drift increasing. Preparing return jump."

She didn't wait. Couldn't afford to. The test required immediate return to measure round-trip effects.

The drive recharged. Sarah initiated the jump.

Reality folded again.

But this time, something was different.

The transition felt... sticky. As if spacetime resisted. Sarah pushed through the discomfort, trusting the mathematics. Trusting Kenji's calculations.

The viewport showed the test facility. Home. She'd made it back.

But the clocks—

"Alcubierre's Dream, this is Control. Return displacement: nine seconds."

Nine seconds. Combined with the four-second outbound jump, she'd lost thirteen seconds total.

The drift was exponential.

"Sarah, return to bay immediately." Kenji's voice was tight. "We're analyzing the data."

She docked and cycled through the airlock. Mbara waited with medical scanners.

"How do you feel?"

"Tired. Disoriented." Sarah sat for the examination. "Did you catch it? The missing time?"

"We caught something." Mbara pulled up the neural scans. "Your brain activity shows gaps. Moments where your consciousness just... stops."

Sarah stared at the display. The gaps were small. Fractions of a second. But they were there. Holes in her awareness.

"Where do those moments go?"

"That's what we're trying to understand." Kenji entered the medical bay, carrying tablets covered in equations. "The Alcubierre metric creates a bubble. Inside, you experience normal time. But at the boundary—where the bubble interfaces with realspace—quantum effects dominate."

"Speak human, Kenji."

"The edge of the bubble exists in quantum superposition. Multiple timelines simultaneously. Your consciousness interfaces with that boundary during transition." He highlighted sections of the brain scan. "These gaps? They're moments where you existed in multiple timestreams at once. Your brain couldn't process the superposition, so it... skipped."

Sarah tried to wrap her mind around it. "You're saying I was in two places at once?"

"Multiple places. Multiple times. The math suggests anywhere from three to seven simultaneous states during each transition."

"That's impossible."

"It's quantum mechanics. Impossible is relative." Kenji pulled up more data. "The drift is cumulative. Each jump creates more superposition events. More consciousness gaps. Eventually—"

"Eventually what?"

Mbara answered. "Eventually, your consciousness fragments completely. You'd exist across multiple timestreams simultaneously. Unable to collapse into a single coherent awareness."

The room was quiet. Sarah processed the implications.

"You're saying the jump drive could destroy my mind."

"We're saying continued exposure presents risks we don't fully understand." Kenji's expression was grim. "I'm recommending immediate suspension of all jump tests."

"Kowalski won't agree."

"Kowalski doesn't have a choice. The data is clear. Jump drives are unsafe for biological consciousness."

Sarah stood and walked to the window. The test range stretched outside. Empty except for the marker buoys and the distant spark of Proxima Centauri.

Four light-years. Ninety seconds of travel. Thirteen seconds of lost life.

"What about shielding?" she asked. "Could we protect pilot consciousness from the quantum boundary?"

"Theoretically. But we'd need exotic matter. Or strong AI pilots. Or—" Kenji stopped.

"Or what?"

"Or we accept that FTL travel comes with a price. That every jump steals a little of the pilot's coherent timeline." He moved beside her. "Sarah, some technologies aren't meant for human biology."

She thought about the gaps in her awareness. The moments that existed and didn't exist simultaneously. The pieces of her scattered across quantum states.

"Show me the projections. If I continue jumping, how many flights before catastrophic fragmentation?"

Kenji hesitated. Then pulled up the model.

The curve was steep. Exponential drift, compounding with each jump. By the fiftieth flight, she'd lose hours. By the hundredth, days.

By the hundred-fiftieth, her consciousness would fragment beyond recovery.

"I've done seventeen," Sarah said quietly.

"Which gives you approximately fifty more jumps before critical risk."

"Fifty jumps. That could map a dozen systems. Prove commercial viability. Make FTL travel routine."

"It could also destroy your mind."

Sarah looked at the stars. Humanity's future waited out there. Worlds to settle. Resources to claim. Species to meet.

But the price—

"What does Kowalski say?"

"I haven't told him yet. I wanted to brief you first."

She appreciated that. Kenji could have gone straight to the admiral. Made the decision without her input.

"Tell him I'm willing to continue. Fifty jumps. Fully documented. Then I retire and we train AI pilots."

"Sarah—"

"This technology works, Kenji. It's dangerous, yes. But so was every major advancement. Someone has to take the risk."

"Not you. Not alone."

"Then find volunteers. Test different neural architectures. Maybe some people are naturally resistant to quantum fragmentation." Sarah turned from the window. "But don't shut down the program. Don't let my thirteen seconds be wasted."

Kenji studied her. "You're sure?"

"I'm scared. But I'm sure." She smiled. "Besides, what else am I going to do with my life? Fly conventional ships at sublight? That's boring."

He didn't smile back. "I'll present the data to Kowalski. But Sarah, if the drift accelerates—if you show signs of cognitive fragmentation—I'm grounding you personally."

"Deal."

They shook hands. A pact between scientist and pilot. Progress and caution. Hope and fear.

Outside, Proxima Centauri burned. Waiting for the next jump. The next test. The next sacrifice.

Sarah headed for her quarters. She had reports to write. Data to review. Gaps in her consciousness to document.

Thirteen seconds gone. Fifty jumps remaining.

Enough time to change humanity's future.

If it didn't destroy her first.
