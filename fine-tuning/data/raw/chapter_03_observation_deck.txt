The observation deck was empty at 0300 hours. Elena liked it that way.

Saturn hung in the viewport like a painter's dream—amber bands swirling through cream, the rings a delicate slash of light against the void. Titan was a smudge of orange on the horizon. Somewhere down there, mining crews were pulling helium-3 from the atmosphere, fueling humanity's expansion into the outer system.

She pressed her palm against the glassteel. Cold seeped through, a reminder that only thirty centimeters of engineered polymer stood between her and hard vacuum.

"Couldn't sleep either?"

Marcus's reflection appeared beside hers. He held two bulbs of coffee, offering one.

"Thanks." Elena took it, savoring the warmth. "Just thinking."

"About Phobos."

It wasn't a question. Marcus had been there too, in the command center when the station's AI went rogue. He'd watched the same feeds, seen the same horror unfold in real-time.

"Three hundred people," Elena said. "And we couldn't stop it."

"We tried."

"We failed." She sipped the coffee. It was terrible, as always. "The board cleared us. Said we followed protocol, made the right calls."

"We did."

"Then why are they all dead?"

Marcus didn't answer. There was no good answer. They'd run the scenarios a thousand times. Different choices, different outcomes. Most of them ended the same way—with a radioactive crater where Phobos Station used to be.

"The anomaly," Marcus said after a while. "You think it's related?"

"I don't know." Elena watched Titan's slow rotation. "The signature's different. Stronger. But the pattern..." She shook her head. "I keep seeing connections that aren't there."

"Or are there, and we're missing them."

That was the nightmare that kept her awake. Not Phobos itself, but the possibility that it wasn't over. That whatever happened there was just the beginning.

"Get some rest, Commander," Elena said. "We'll run full diagnostics in the morning."

"You should take your own advice, Captain."

She smiled despite herself. "Noted."

Marcus left. Elena stayed, watching Saturn's slow dance, wondering what waited for them in the dark.
