The Falcon's proximity alarms woke Jax at 0400. Someone was following them.

He pulled up the sensors from his bunk, eyes adjusting to the dim display. A ship, twenty thousand klicks behind and closing. No transponder. Running dark.

Corporate hunters.

"Kayla, you seeing this?" Jax keyed the comm.

"Yeah. Been tracking them for two hours. Wanted to let you sleep." Kayla's voice was tight. "They're matching our trajectory, maintaining distance. Professional tail."

Jax was on the bridge in under a minute, Chen and Sofia arriving moments later.

"How long until they intercept?" Jax asked.

"At current closure rate? Eighteen hours." Kayla pulled up tactical displays. "But they're not trying to intercept. Just shadow us. See where we're going."

"Because they think we know where to find more xenonite." Sofia studied the pursuing ship's energy signature. "That's a Helios surveyor-class. Equipped for long-range tracking and resource detection."

"They're going to follow us until we find another deposit, then claim it before we can file." Chen spat on the deck—a crude habit from his mining station days. "Standard corporate theft."

Jax considered their options. They were three days into a survey run, looking for nickel-iron asteroids. Standard work. Nothing exotic. Nothing that would interest Helios.

But Helios didn't know that. They thought the Falcon's crew was hunting more miracle materials.

"We could lead them on a wild chase," Kayla suggested. "Burn fuel visiting worthless rocks until they give up."

"How much fuel do we have for wild chases?" Jax asked.

"Not enough. We're already running lean after the xenonite escape."

Sofia was studying the tactical display with unusual intensity. "What if we don't run? What if we use them?"

"Explain."

"They want to follow us to valuable deposits. So we lead them to someone else's claim. Make them look like they're claim-jumping. Get them in trouble with Belt Authority."

"That's..." Chen grinned. "That's sneaky. I love it."

"It's also risky," Jax said. "If it backfires, we're the ones getting prosecuted for false claims."

"Better prosecuted than dead." Sofia pulled up asteroid registries. "There's a Midas Corporation claim three days burn from here. Large nickel deposit, well established. If Helios gets caught surveying their claim without permission, Midas will file complaints that even Helios can't ignore."

Kayla checked the navigation. "I can plot a course that looks like we're prospecting near their claim zone. Get close enough to trigger their security without actually trespassing."

"How close?" Jax asked.

"Ten thousand klicks. Right at the edge of their exclusion radius. Legal, but suspicious."

Jax weighed the options. Leading Helios into trouble was satisfying. But it could also escalate the conflict. Helios had resources, lawyers, and a long memory.

On the other hand, they were already marked. The xenonite incident had made them enemies. Might as well use that status.

"Do it," Jax decided. "Plot course to the Midas claim zone. Make it look like we're prospecting but stay legal. Let Helios make the mistake."

The next three days were tense. The Helios ship maintained its tail, never quite close enough to engage, never far enough to lose track. Patient. Professional.

Dangerous.

They reached the Midas claim zone at 1600 on the third day. Kayla brought them in at exactly ten thousand one hundred klicks from the claim boundary—legal buffer preserved.

"Deploy survey drones," Jax ordered. "Make it look real."

Sofia launched three survey drones, sending them toward nearby unclaimed asteroids. Standard prospecting procedure. Nothing suspicious.

The Helios ship crept closer.

"They're moving into the exclusion zone," Kayla reported. "Nine thousand klicks from the Midas claim. Eight thousand."

"Midas security will have detected them by now," Sofia said. "Question is whether they'll respond or just log the intrusion."

Seven thousand klicks. Six thousand.

Jax's comm buzzed. Encrypted channel, Midas Corporation security frequency.

"Unidentified vessel, this is Midas Security. You are approaching our exclusion zone. State your business."

Jax opened the channel. "Midas Security, this is independent mining vessel Falcon. We're conducting surveys in unclaimed territory. We have no intention of approaching your claim."

"Acknowledged, Falcon. We're tracking a second vessel behind you. Are they with you?"

"Negative. They've been following us for three days. We don't know their intentions."

"Understood. Stand by."

The channel closed. Jax watched the tactical display, barely breathing.

The Helios ship was at five thousand klicks from the Midas claim. Still closing.

Then Midas security lit them up. High-powered targeting lasers, not weapons but unmistakable warning. The kind of display that said "we see you, we're ready, back off."

The Helios ship stopped. Held position for ten seconds. Then began withdrawing.

Too late. They'd crossed into the exclusion zone. Midas would have logged everything.

"They're retreating," Kayla said. "Heading back toward the belt."

Sofia was grinning. "Midas will file a claim-jumping complaint. Helios will have to deal with corporate legal warfare. That'll keep them busy for months."

"Unless they connect us to the incident," Jax said. "Then we're back to running."

His comm buzzed again. Midas Security.

"Captain Torres, thank you for the report on the trailing vessel. We've identified it as a Helios surveyor-class, known for claim-jumping operations. You did us a favor."

"Happy to help, Midas Security."

"We noted your survey operations are legitimate and properly licensed. If you need supplies or assistance, our station is available. Professional courtesy for the heads-up."

Jax felt tension easing. "Appreciated, Midas Security. We'll keep that in mind."

The channel closed. Chen was laughing quietly.

"We just got Helios in trouble with their biggest competitor, and earned goodwill with Midas. That's beautiful."

"Don't celebrate yet," Jax warned. "Helios knows we led them into that trap. They'll be angry."

"Let them be angry," Sofia said. "We're still alive, still mining, still free. That's what matters."

The Falcon resumed its survey run, this time without a tail. The drones returned data on several promising nickel-iron deposits—nothing exotic, but solid commercial prospects.

Three days later, they filed claims and began extraction operations. Standard work. The kind of mining that paid bills without attracting corporate attention.

Sofia seemed disappointed by the mundane ore, but she didn't complain. She'd learned the hard way that exotic discoveries brought exotic problems.

"How much longer until we're clear of our debts?" she asked Jax one evening.

He pulled up the financials. "Six months of steady work. Maybe eight if we hit any major repairs."

"And then?"

"Then we're actually independent. No loans, no corporate obligations. Just us and whatever we can find in the belt."

"Think we'll make it?"

Jax looked at his crew. Kayla maintaining the ship's systems with obsessive care. Chen working miracles with aging equipment. Sofia analyzing every sample like it might be the next big discovery.

"Yeah," he said. "We'll make it."

A week later, Jax received an encrypted message. No sender ID, but the routing suggested it came from deep in the belt.

"Captain Torres, Helios doesn't forget. We know what you did. You cost us a valuable claim and significant legal complications. Consider this a warning: the belt is smaller than you think. We'll be watching."

Jax deleted the message without responding. Threats were just noise. They'd survived worse.

Chen found him on the bridge later, reading the deleted message logs.

"More corporate intimidation?" Chen asked.

"Standard stuff. Helios trying to make us nervous."

"Is it working?"

"Not yet." Jax pulled up their next survey targets. "We keep working. Keep moving. Stay ahead of trouble."

"And if trouble catches up?"

"Then we deal with it. Like we always do."

Chen nodded and returned to the engine bay. Jax stayed on the bridge, looking at the star field displayed across the main screen.

The belt was vast. Millions of asteroids, billions of tons of ore. Room enough for small operators to disappear if they were careful.

Or room enough for corporate hunters to stalk their prey without witnesses.

Either way, the Falcon would keep flying. Keep mining. Keep earning their freedom one ore load at a time.

Because the alternative was giving up. And Jax Torres didn't know how to do that.

He'd learned that lesson in his corporate days, back when Helios had stolen his first claim. You either fought back or you became someone's victim.

Jax had chosen to fight.

Still was fighting.

Always would be.

The Falcon's engines hummed, steady and strong despite their age. Chen's maintenance kept them running. Kayla's piloting kept them safe. Sofia's analysis kept them profitable.

And Jax's stubbornness kept them free.

That was enough.

For now.

Forever, if he had anything to say about it.

The belt stretched infinite and hostile and full of possibility. Somewhere out there was the next claim, the next score, the next chance.

All they had to do was survive long enough to find it.

Jax Torres had been surviving for a long time.

He'd survive this too.
