The airlock warning blared at 0300 hours. Someone was cycling through from the surface without authorization.

Rivera grabbed her sidearm and headed for the bay. Emergency protocol dictated she assume hostile intent until proven otherwise. Mars didn't have pirates or raiders, but equipment thieves and saboteurs weren't impossible.

She arrived to find Alexis Kwan stripping out of her EVA suit, her face flushed.

"Unauthorized surface activity," Rivera said, her weapon lowered but not holstered. "Explain."

Alexis pulled off her helmet. Dust cascaded to the floor. "I found something."

"At three in the morning?"

"Couldn't sleep. Decided to check the remote solar array installation site."

Rivera holstered her weapon. "The site Hassan found the subsurface chamber?"

"Three hundred meters south of it. I was running ground-penetrating surveys when I hit something." Alexis pulled up her tablet. "Look."

The radar image showed a hollow space. Large. Regular. And definitely not natural.

"Another chamber?" Rivera asked.

"Or part of the same structure. The radar suggests they're connected underground." Alexis highlighted the connection. "Commander, I think we've been building our colony on top of something bigger than we realized."

Rivera studied the data. The implications were staggering. If Mars harbored extensive subsurface structures, that changed everything humanity thought they knew about the planet's history.

"We need to map the full extent," she said.

"I agree. But that's not why I woke you up." Alexis pulled up another image. "I found this."

The scan showed an opening. Deliberate. Regular. Almost like a doorway.

"You didn't go inside," Rivera said. It wasn't a question.

"I'm reckless, not stupid. But Commander, whatever built this put the entrance three hundred meters from our planned construction site. If we'd started digging without surveying—"

"We would have broken through into it." Rivera felt a chill. "Potential structural collapse. Possible atmospheric breach if the chamber was pressurized."

"Or contamination if it contained anything biological."

They looked at each other. The protocols for alien contact were clear: document, report, wait for Earth approval before proceeding. But Earth was eight minutes away at light speed. Decisions took weeks.

The colony needed power in days.

"We can't build there," Rivera said.

"I know. I'm already revising the site selection." Alexis pulled up alternative locations. "But this puts us back to square one on power generation."

"Then we find another solution."

"There isn't one. Not with current resources." Alexis sat heavily on a storage crate. "We're trapped, Commander. We can't expand production without risking the subsurface structures, and we can't sustain the colony without expanding production."

Rivera moved to the viewport. Mars stretched outside, red and ancient. A world that had kept secrets for billions of years.

Now those secrets were interfering with human survival.

"Hassan needs to survey the full extent of the structures," she said. "Map everything. Then we'll know what we're dealing with."

"That'll take weeks. We don't have weeks."

"Then he works fast." Rivera turned back. "In the meantime, you find a power solution that doesn't involve digging near alien artifacts."

"I'll try."

"Don't try. Succeed." Rivera softened her tone. "I know I'm asking the impossible, Alexis. But that's what we do here. Make the impossible routine."

Alexis stood. "I'll draft new proposals. But Commander, we need to discuss the bigger question."

"Which is?"

"What do we do if these structures are still active? If whatever built them is still here, just dormant or hidden?"

Rivera had been avoiding that thought. Now it sat between them, unavoidable.

"First contact protocol," she said. "We observe, document, avoid interference. Until Earth sends specialists."

"And if the structures wake up before the specialists arrive?"

"Then we deal with it. Same as everything else."

Alexis nodded slowly. "You ever wonder if we're the aliens here? If Mars already had inhabitants and we just didn't notice?"

"All the time." Rivera headed for the door. "Get some sleep, Kwan. We'll tackle this fresh in the morning."

"It is morning."

"Then we'll tackle it fresh in a few hours."

Alone in the bay, Rivera reviewed the scans Alexis had found. The chamber system was extensive. Kilometers of tunnels and spaces, all showing signs of deliberate construction.

Mars wasn't dead. It was hiding.

She sent a coded transmission to Earth. Priority one. Full disclosure of the subsurface findings. Request for immediate guidance.

The response would take weeks. By then, they'd need to have made decisions on their own.

Rivera pulled up the colony's resource projections. The numbers were brutal. Without expanded power generation, they'd start rationing within days. With it, they risked disturbing something humanity wasn't ready to understand.

Choose survival or choose caution. There wasn't room for both.

She thought about the two hundred people sleeping in the habitat. Crew members who'd trusted her leadership. Who'd followed her to Mars believing in the mission.

She couldn't let them die because of unknowns.

But she couldn't risk catastrophe by ignoring alien structures either.

Rivera made her decision. They'd map the subsurface completely. Understand the scope. Then, if necessary, they'd build anyway. Carefully. With protocols to detect and respond to any changes in the structures.

Risk management. Not elimination. Because on Mars, risk was part of the job.

She composed messages to Hassan and Alexis. Orders. Timelines. Expectations.

Then she allowed herself five minutes to sit in the quiet bay and feel the weight of command.

Two hundred lives. Alien artifacts. Corporate demands. Equipment failures. Resource shortages.

Just another day on Mars.

Rivera stood, straightened her uniform, and headed for her quarters. Three hours until the staff meeting. She'd brief them on the findings, outline the response plan, and project confidence she didn't entirely feel.

That's what commanders did. They made decisions in uncertainty and carried the burden alone.

So the crew could sleep.

And wake up believing everything would work out.

Even when the commander knew better.

Especially then.
