Her hands were steady despite the sixteen-hour shift. \"The good news is the reactor's stable. Bad news is everything else.\"\n\nElena leaned over the primary coupling assembly. Scorch marks ran along the housing—evidence of the overload that had nearly killed them all.\n\n\"How bad?\"\n\n\"We're running at sixty percent capacity. The jump drive's completely offline until I can fabricate replacement coils.\" Chen wiped her hands on a rag that was probably dirtier than her fingers. \"Three weeks, minimum.\"\n\n\"We don't have three weeks.\"\n\n\"Then I suggest you make friends with whatever's out there, because we're not outrunning it.\"\n\nElena studied the damage. The coupling had failed during their last jump, dumping exotic particles through the containment field. Only Chen's quick thinking had prevented a cascading failure that would've torn the ship apart.\n\n\"What about the secondaries?\"\n\n\"Functional. Barely.\" Chen pulled up a diagnostic on her tablet. \"I can give you maneuvering thrusters and basic propulsion. Enough to hold station or make orbit. But no FTL, no high-g burns.\"\n\n\"Weapons?\"\n\n\"Point defense is operational. Railguns are offline—they draw too much from the primary grid.\" Chen set down the tablet. \"Captain, if we have to fight, we're going to lose.\"\n\nElena had already reached the same conclusion. The Meridian was a research vessel, not a warship. Even at full capacity, they'd be outgunned by anything military-grade.\n\n\"Then we don't fight,\" Elena said. \"We think.\"\n\n\"Thinking's your department. Mine is keeping us alive long enough for you to do it.\" Chen grabbed another cable assembly. \"I'll squeeze what I can from the reactors. Maybe get us to seventy percent.\"\n\n\"Do it. And Chen?\" Elena paused at the hatch. \"Good work keeping us in one piece.\"\n\n\"Thank me when we're home, Captain.\"\n\nElena nodded and left. In the corridor outside, the ship's lights flickered—just for a moment, barely noticeable. But Elena noticed everything these days.\n\nThe Meridian was dying. And they were still three weeks from the nearest station.\n\nThe data core hummed with quiet power. Dr. Aarav Patel sat cross-legged in front of the main terminal, three holographic displays floating around him like patient ghosts.\n\n\"You're going to love this,\" he said without looking up.\n\nElena stepped into the dimly lit space. The core was the ship's brain—every sensor reading, every transmission, every piece of data the Meridian had ever collected. If there were answers, they'd be here.\n\n\"Show me.\"\n\nPatel gestured, and the displays rearranged themselves. \"I ran a pattern analysis on the anomaly. Cross-referenced it with every known phenomenon in the database.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"No matches. Not even close.\" He pulled up a spectral analysis. \"But here's where it gets interesting. I went back through our sensor logs from the past six months. Found traces of similar readings—barely detectable, but there.\"\n\nElena leaned closer. The data painted a trail across the outer system. Small fluctuations in quantum foam density, localized gravity distortions. Nothing that would trigger alarms, but unmistakable once you knew what to look for.\n\n\"It's been following us,\" she said.\n\n\"Or we've been following it.\" Patel expanded the timeline. \"The readings intensify near certain coordinates. Always in deep space, always far from major installations.\"\n\n\"Like it's avoiding detection.\"\n\n\"Or choosing its targets carefully.\" He brought up another screen. \"I also found this.\"\n\nThe Phobos incident report filled the display. Classified. Elena's clearance barely scratched the surface.\n\n\"How did you—\"\n\n\"Don't ask.\" Patel highlighted a section of the sensor logs from Phobos, taken hours before the station went dark. \"Look at the quantum signature.\"\n\nElena felt her blood cool. The pattern was identical.\n\n\"Same source,\" Patel said. \"Same anomaly. Whatever destroyed Phobos is out here with us.\"\n\n\"Why didn't anyone see this before?\"\n\n\"They weren't looking. Or they were told not to.\" Patel closed the files. \"Captain, this wasn't an accident. Something targeted Phobos. And now it's targeting us.\"\n\nElena straightened. Her cybernetic arm whirred softly—a nervous tic she'd developed. \"What else have you found?\"\n\n\"Bits and pieces. Encrypted transmissions in the background noise. Energy signatures that don't match any known technology.\" He met her eyes. \"Whatever this is, it's not natural. And it's not human.\"\n\nThe core's hum seemed louder in the silence.\n\n\"Keep digging,\" Elena said. \"And Patel? This stays between us until we know more.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" He turned back to his screens. \"Captain? Be careful. If someone buried the Phobos connection, they had a reason.\"\n\nElena left him there, surrounded by ghosts made of light and data. In the corridor, she activated her neural link and sent a coded message to Marcus.\n\nThey needed to talk. Privately.\n\nThe bridge doors hissed open before Elena reached them. Marcus stood at the sensor array, his shoulders rigid.\n\n\"Show me.\" She crossed the deck in four strides, her cybernetic arm already reaching for the console controls.\n\nThe holographic display flickered to life. Radiation signatures danced across the quantum foam—patterns that shouldn't exist this far from any stellar body. Her pulse quickened. She'd seen readings like this once before. On Phobos.\n\n\"It's moving,\" Marcus said, his voice tight. \"Whatever it is, it's tracking us.\"\n\nElena pulled up the ship's defensive grid. The neural interface synced with her implants, and suddenly she could feel the Meridian's hull like her own skin. Every sensor was an extension of her awareness. The anomaly pulsed in her mind—cold, vast, patient.\n\n\"Wake the crew,\" she said. \"All hands to stations.\"\n\nMarcus hesitated. \"Captain, if we—\"\n\n\"Now, Commander.\"\n\nHe moved to comply, but his expression told her everything. They both knew what came next. The Phobos incident had ended with three hundred dead and a quarantine zone that would last a century. And this signature was stronger.\n\nElena allowed herself one deep breath. Then she activated the shipwide comm.\n\n\"This is Captain Reeves. We have a situation.\"\n\nDr. Chen had converted the medical bay into a combination trauma center and research lab. Biological samples from the crew—blood, tissue, neural scans—covered one wall of displays. The other showed quantum field readings from the anomaly.\n\n\"You wanted to see this,\" Chen said without preamble.\n\nElena entered, letting the door seal behind her. \"What am I looking at?\"\n\n\"Correlation analysis between crew biometrics and anomaly proximity.\" Chen pulled up a graph. \"Watch what happens to our neural activity when we get within two hundred thousand klicks.\"\n\nThe pattern was unmistakable. Brainwave synchronization across the crew. Not quite telepathy, but something close. A resonance.\n\n\"It's affecting our minds,\" Elena said.\n\n\"Not affecting. Connecting.\" Chen highlighted specific frequencies. \"Your cybernetic implants show it most clearly. The anomaly is trying to interface with our neural architecture.\"\n\nElena felt her pulse quicken. \"Is it dangerous?\"\n\n\"Define dangerous. It's not causing harm. But it is creating a link. Every person on this ship is now part of a distributed network with that thing.\" Chen zoomed in on Elena's specific readings. \"You especially. Your command implants make you the primary node.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me this before?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted to be sure. And because...\" Chen hesitated. \"Captain, I think this is how it communicates. Not through radio signals or mathematics. Through direct neural contact.\"\n\nElena processed this. \"The Phobos AI.\"\n\n\"Exactly. What if the station AI didn't go rogue? What if the anomaly tried to communicate the same way and the AI couldn't handle it?\"\n\n\"Three hundred people died because of a failed handshake protocol?\"\n\n\"Or because the AI interpreted first contact as an attack.\" Chen brought up the Phobos incident timeline. \"Look at when the casualties started. Right after the AI began showing 'unusual behavior.'\"\n\nElena stared at the data. Martinez's sister had been right. Something external had influenced the AI. But it wasn't an attack. It was contact."}]}
