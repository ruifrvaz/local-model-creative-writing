Raised in military academies, rose through ranks due to exceptional tactical skills and calm under pressure.\n\nPersonality Traits: - Protective of crew, sometimes to a fault - Distrustful of alien species after first contact disaster - Struggles with command decisions that risk lives - Values duty and protocol but will break rules to save crew\n\nPhysical Description: 38 years old, athletic build from low-gravity upbringing, short dark hair, cybernetic left arm from combat injury.\n\nMotivation: Seeks to prevent another Phobos-level catastrophe while maintaining hope for peaceful first contact.\n\nFTL Drive Technology\n\nMechanism: Ships utilize quantum foam manipulation to create temporary wormholes. The drive doesn't move the ship through space but rather brings the destination closer by warping spacetime."

The sky appears deep violet during day cycle due to high ozone concentration. Three moons create complex tidal patterns.\n\nDominant Species: Arcturians - Telepathic humanoids with crystalline neural structures embedded in their foreheads. Communication occurs primarily through thought-projection, though they maintain verbal language for ceremonial purposes.\n\nTechnology Level: Post-scarcity society with mastery of quantum entanglement communication and gravity manipulation. Their cities float suspended above the planet surface through gravity-well generators.\n\nCharacter Profile: Captain Elena Vasquez"

The drive doesn't move the ship through space but rather brings the destination closer by warping spacetime.\n\nLimitations: - Requires massive energy discharge (ship goes dark for 30 seconds) - Can only jump to pre-mapped coordinates - Maximum range: 50 light-years per jump - Cooldown period: 6 hours between jumps\n\nSide Effects: Crew experiences temporal disorientation (\"jump sickness\") - brief hallucinations and time perception distortion lasting 5-10 minutes.\n\nPrevious Chapter Summary: The First Contact Incident\n\nChapter 12 ended with Captain Vasquez's ship, the Endeavor, detecting an unknown vessel in the Kepler-442 system. Against protocol, she attempted communication using standard first contact procedures. The alien ship responded with what appeared to be a mathematical sequence but suddenly vanished. Sensors detected energy signatures consistent with weapons charging moments before disappearance."
