The sky appears deep violet during day cycle due to high ozone concentration. Three moons create complex tidal patterns.\n\nDominant Species: Arcturians - Telepathic humanoids with crystalline neural structures embedded in their foreheads. Communication occurs primarily through thought-projection, though they maintain verbal language for ceremonial purposes.\n\nTechnology Level: Post-scarcity society with mastery of quantum entanglement communication and gravity manipulation. Their cities float suspended above the planet surface through gravity-well generators.\n\nCharacter Profile: Captain Elena Vasquez"

Raised in military academies, rose through ranks due to exceptional tactical skills and calm under pressure.\n\nPersonality Traits: - Protective of crew, sometimes to a fault - Distrustful of alien species after first contact disaster - Struggles with command decisions that risk lives - Values duty and protocol but will break rules to save crew\n\nPhysical Description: 38 years old, athletic build from low-gravity upbringing, short dark hair, cybernetic left arm from combat injury.\n\nMotivation: Seeks to prevent another Phobos-level catastrophe while maintaining hope for peaceful first contact.\n\nFTL Drive Technology\n\nMechanism: Ships utilize quantum foam manipulation to create temporary wormholes. The drive doesn't move the ship through space but rather brings the destination closer by warping spacetime."
