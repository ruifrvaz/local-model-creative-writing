Raised in military academies, rose through ranks due to exceptional tactical skills and calm under pressure.\n\nPersonality Traits: - Protective of crew, sometimes to a fault - Distrustful of alien species after first contact disaster - Struggles with command decisions that risk lives - Values duty and protocol but will break rules to save crew\n\nPhysical Description: 38 years old, athletic build from low-gravity upbringing, short dark hair, cybernetic left arm from combat injury.\n\nMotivation: Seeks to prevent another Phobos-level catastrophe while maintaining hope for peaceful first contact.\n\nFTL Drive Technology\n\nMechanism: Ships utilize quantum foam manipulation to create temporary wormholes. The drive doesn't move the ship through space but rather brings the destination closer by warping spacetime."

The sky appears deep violet during day cycle due to high ozone concentration. Three moons create complex tidal patterns.\n\nDominant Species: Arcturians - Telepathic humanoids with crystalline neural structures embedded in their foreheads. Communication occurs primarily through thought-projection, though they maintain verbal language for ceremonial purposes.\n\nTechnology Level: Post-scarcity society with mastery of quantum entanglement communication and gravity manipulation. Their cities float suspended above the planet surface through gravity-well generators.\n\nCharacter Profile: Captain Elena Vasquez"
